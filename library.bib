abstract = {This paper proposes the idea of using a generative adversarial network (GAN) to assist a novice user in designing real-world shapes with a simple interface. The user edits a voxel grid with a painting interface (like Minecraft). Yet, at any time, he/she can execute a SNAP command, which projects the current voxel grid onto a latent shape manifold with a learned projection operator and then generates a similar, but more realistic, shape using a learned generator network. Then the user can edit the resulting shape and snap again until he/she is satisfied with the result. The main advantage of this approach is that the projection and generation operators assist novice users to create 3D models characteristic of a background distribution of object shapes, but without having to specify all the details. The core new research idea is to use a GAN to support this application. 3D GANs have previously been used for shape generation, interpolation, and completion, but never for interactive modeling. The new challenge for this application is to learn a projection operator that takes an arbitrary 3D voxel model and produces a latent vector on the shape manifold from which a similar and realistic shape can be generated. We develop algorithms for this and other steps of the SNAP processing pipeline and integrate them into a simple modeling tool. Experiments with these algorithms and tool suggest that GANs provide a promising approach to computer-assisted interactive modeling.},

abstract = {We address the problem of semantic segmentation: classifying each pixel in an image according to the semantic class it belongs to (e.g. dog, road, car). Most existing methods train from fully supervised images, where each pixel is annotated by a class label. To reduce the annotation effort, recently a few weakly supervised approaches emerged. These require only image labels indicating which classes are present. Although their performance reaches a satisfactory level, there is still a substantial gap between the accuracy of fully and weakly supervised methods. We address this gap with a novel active learning method specifically suited for this setting. We model the problem as a pairwise CRF and cast active learning as finding its most informative nodes. These nodes induce the largest expected change in the overall CRF state, after revealing their true label. Our criterion is equivalent to maximizing an upper-bound on accuracy gain. Experiments on two data-sets show that our method achieves 97{\%} percent of the accuracy of the corresponding fully supervised model, while querying less than 17{\%} of the (super-)pixel labels.},

abstract = {Learning invariant representations is an important problem in machine learning and pattern recognition. In this paper, we present a novel framework of transformationinvariant feature learning by incorporating linear transformations into the feature learning algorithms. For example, we present the transformation-invariant restricted Boltzmann machine that compactly represents data by its weights and their transformations, which achieves invariance of the feature representation via probabilistic max pooling. In addition, we show that our transformation-invariant feature learning framework can also be extended to other unsupervised learning methods, such as autoencoders or sparse coding. We evaluate our method on several image classi cation benchmark datasets, such as MNIST variations, CIFAR-10, and STL-10, and show competitive or superior classi cation performance when compared to the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our method achieves state-of-theart performance on phone classi cation tasks with the TIMIT dataset, which demonstrates wide applicability of our proposed algorithms to other domains.},

We report early experiments with a system that makes use of both model parallelism and data parallelism, we call GPU A-SGD. We show using GPU A-SGD it is possible to speed up training of large convolutional neural networks useful for computer vision.

@article{Marianayagam2014,
abstract = {Crystal arthropathies are a diverse group of disorders characterized by deposition of various minerals in joints and soft tissues leading to inflammation. Clinical presentations of the different types of crystal arthritis are often characteristic enough to differentiate them from each other and other inflammatory arthropathies, but mistakes can be made, leading to delayed or incorrect management. Gout, the most common crystal arthropathy, is caused by monosodium urate crystal precipitation and appears to be increasing in clinical complexity and prevalence. In addition to gout, two other main crystal types are associated with inflammatory symptoms resulting from their deposition in and around joints. These are calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate, causing pseudogout, and basic calcium phosphate (BCP/hydroxyapatite). The most accurate way of diagnosing the common forms of crystal-associated arthritis is through the identification of specific crystals in synovial fluid. Crystal arthritis causes exquisite pain, and management is directed towards the control of acute flares, followed by prevention of recurrent episodes. Traditionally, the prophylaxis of gout has depended largely on the use of allopurinol, but newer drugs such as febuxostat are proving to be useful for those who cannot tolerate allopurinol. Better understanding of the pathophysiology of the disorder has led to the development of biologic treatments, which are showing promise as potential treatment strategies in resistant cases. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We regularize this classifier by aggregating histograms in the neighborhood of each superpixel and then refine our results further by using the classifier in a conditional random field operating on the superpixel graph. Our proposed method exceeds the previously published state-of-the-art on two challenging datasets: Graz-02 and the PASCAL VOC 2007 Segmentation Challenge.},

It assumes basic mathematical knowledge in areas such as cal- culus, vector geometry and Lagrange multipliers. The document has been split into Theory and Application sections so that it is obvious, after the maths has been dealt with, how to actually apply the SVM for the different forms of problem that each section is centred on. The document's first section details the problem of classification for linearly separable data and introduces the concept of margin and the essence of SVM - margin maximization. The methodology of the SVM is then extended to data which is not fully linearly separable. This soft margin SVM introduces the idea of slack variables and the trade-off between maximizing the margin and minimizing the number of misclassified variables in the second section. The third section develops the concept of SVM further so that the technique can be used for regression. The fourth section explains the other salient feature of SVM - the Kernel Trick. It explains how incorporation of this mathematical sleight of hand allows SVM to classify and regress nonlinear data.},

This enables the inferences of the model to transform in response to transformed input data in a stable and predictable way, and avoids learning multiple features differing only with respect to the set of transformations. Extending prior work on translation equivariant (convolutional) models, we develop translation and rotation equivariant restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) and deep belief nets (DBNs), and demonstrate their effectiveness in learning frequently occurring statistical structure from artificial and natural images.},

abstract = {Recreational diving developed in the late 1940s when self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA) first became available for civilian use. At the same time the development of the commercial airliner, in particular the jet airliner, made possible the concept of international travel for pleasure as opposed to business. Over the past 50 years the number of international tourists has increased by over 2500{\%} from a mere 25 million in 1950 to over 700 million in 2002 (Treadwell TL. Trends in travel. In: Zuckerman JN, editor. Principles and practice of travel medicine, 2001; p. 2-6). The popularity of recreational diving has also increased over the same period from an activity experienced by a small number of individuals in the early 1950s to an activity today enjoyed by many millions. The combination of increased international travel and the means by which to enter and explore the underwater world has led to diving becoming increasingly popular as a tourist activity. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Cheng2015,
abstract = {This paper studies the problem of improving object recognition using the novel RGB-D data. To address the problem, a new convolutional Fisher Kernels (CFK) method is proposed to represent RGB-D objects powerfully yet efficiently. The core idea of our approach is to integrate the both advantages of the convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Fisher Kernel encoding (FK): CNN model is flexible to adapt to new data sources, but requires for large amounts of training data with significant computational resources for good generalization, In comparison, FK encoding is able to represent objects powerfully and efficiently with small training data, however, its success highly depends on the well-designed SIFT features in literature, which may not be suitable for the new depth data. CFK can be interpreted as a two-layer feature learning structure to bridge the two models. The first layer employs a single-layer CNN to learn low-level translation ally invariant features for both RGB and depth data efficiently. The second layer aggregates the convolutional responses by FK encoding. Here 2D and 3D spatial pyramids are applied to further improve the Fisher vector representation of each modality. Experiments on RGB-D object recognition benchmarks demonstrate that our approach can achieve the state-of-the-art results.},

abstract = {Image category recognition is important to access visual information on the level of objects and scene types. So far, intensity-based descriptors have been widely used for feature extraction at salient points. To increase illumination invariance and discriminative power, color descriptors have been proposed. Because many different descriptors exist, a structured overview is required of color invariant descriptors in the context of image category recognition. Therefore, this paper studies the invariance properties and the distinctiveness of color descriptors (software to compute the color descriptors from this paper is available from http://www.colordescriptors.com) in a structured way. The analytical invariance properties of color descriptors are explored, using a taxonomy based on invariance properties with respect to photometric transformations, and tested experimentally using a data set with known illumination conditions. In addition, the distinctiveness of color descriptors is assessed experimentally using two benchmarks, one from the image domain and one from the video domain. From the theoretical and experimental results, it can be derived that invariance to light intensity changes and light color changes affects category recognition. The results further reveal that, for light intensity shifts, the usefulness of invariance is category-specific. Overall, when choosing a single descriptor and no prior knowledge about the data set and object and scene categories is available, the OpponentSIFT is recommended. Furthermore, a combined set of color descriptors outperforms intensity-based SIFT and improves category recognition by 8 percent on the PASCAL VOC 2007 and by 7 percent on the Mediamill Challenge.},

Throughout the paper, we document many of the practical steps needed to produce a computer vision system such as ours, which currently has nearly a million users. 1},

abstract = {We consider the problem of designing models to leverage a recently introduced approximate model averaging technique called dropout. We define a simple new model called maxout (so named because its output is the max of a set of inputs, and because it is a natural companion to dropout) designed to both facilitate optimization by dropout and improve the accuracy of dropout's fast approximate model averaging technique. We empirically verify that the model successfully accomplishes both of these tasks. We use maxout and dropout to demonstrate state of the art classification performance on four benchmark datasets: MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN.},

This is achieved by gathering images of complex everyday scenes containing common objects in their natural context. Objects are labeled using per-instance segmentations to aid in precise object localization. Our dataset contains photos of 91 objects types that would be easily recognizable by a 4 year old. With a total of 2.5 million labeled instances in 328k images, the creation of our dataset drew upon extensive crowd worker involvement via novel user interfaces for category detection, instance spotting and instance segmentation. We present a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset in comparison to PASCAL, ImageNet, and SUN. Finally, we provide baseline performance analysis for bounding box and segmentation detection results using a Deformable Parts Model.},

abstract = {The artificial neural networks that are used to recognise shapes typcially use one or more layers of learned feature detectors that produce scalar outputs. By contrast, the computer vision community uses complicated, hand-engineered representations of the pose of the feature, like SIFT, that produce a whole vector of outputs including an explicit representation of the pose of the feature. We show how neural networks can be used to learn features that output a whole vector of instatiation parameters and we argue that this is a much more promising way of dealing with variations in position, orientation, scale and lighting than the methods currently employed in the neural networks community. It is also more promising than the hand-engineered features currently used in computer vision because it provides an efficient way of adpating the features to the domain},

abstract = {Many algorithms are available to learn deep hierarchies of features from unlabeled data, especially images. In many cases, these algorithms involve multi-layered networks of features (e.g., neural net- works) that are sometimes tricky to train and tune and are difficult to scale up to many machines effectively. Recently, it has been found that K-means clustering can be used as a fast alternative training method. The main advantage of this approach is that it is very fast and easily implemented at large scale. On the other hand, employing this method in practice is not completely trivial: K-means has several limitations, and care must be taken to combine the right ingredients to get the system to work well. This chapter will summarize recent results and technical tricks that are needed to make effective use of K-means clustering for learning large-scale representations of images.We will also connect these results to other well-known algorithms to make clear when K-means can be most useful and convey intuitions about its behavior that are useful for debugging and engineering new systems. 1},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

It has been shown that these networks still work well when they are applied to datasets or recognition tasks different from those they were trained on. However, descriptors like SIFT are not only used in recognition but also for many correspondence problems that rely on descriptor matching. In this paper we compare features from various layers of convolutional neural nets to standard SIFT descriptors. We consider a network that was trained on ImageNet and another one that was trained without supervision. Surprisingly, convolutional neural networks clearly outperform SIFT on descriptor matching.},

abstract = {Many computer vision applications require computing structure and feature correspondence across a large, unorganized image collection. This is a computationally expensive process, because the graph of matching image pairs is unknown in advance, and so methods for quickly and accurately predicting which of the O(n 2) pairs of images match are critical. Image comparison methods such as bag-of-words models or global features are often used to predict similar pairs, but can be very noisy. In this paper, we propose a new image matching method that uses discriminative learning techniques?applied to training data gathered automatically during the image matching process?to gradually compute a better similarity measure for predicting whether two images in a given collection overlap. By using such a learned similarity measure, our algorithm can select image pairs that are more likely to match for performing further feature matching and geometric verification, improving the overall efficiency of the matching process. Our approach processes a set of images in an iterative manner, alternately performing pairwise feature matching and learning an improved similarity measure. Our experiments show that our learned measures can significantly improve match prediction over the standard tf-idf-weighted similarity and more recent unsupervised techniques even with small amounts of training data, and can improve the overall speed of the image matching process by more than a factor of two.},

abstract = {While logistic sigmoid neurons are more biologically plausable that hyperbolic tangent neurons, the latter work better for training multi-layer neural networks. This paper shows that rectifying neurons are an even better model of biological neurons and yield equal or better performance than hyperbolic tangent networks in spite of the hard non-linearity and non-differentiability at zero, creating sparse representations with true zeros, which seem remarkably suitable for naturally sparse data. Even though they can take advantage of semi-supervised setups with extra-unlabelled data, deep rectifier networks can reach their best performance without requiring any unsupervised pre-training on purely supervised tasks with large labelled data sets. Hence, these results can be seen as a new milestone in the attempts at understanding the difficulty in training deep but purely supervised nueral networks, and closing the performance gap between neural networks learnt with and without unsupervised pre-training},

abstract = {While image alignment has been studied in different areas of computer vision for decades, aligning images depicting different scenes remains a challenging problem. Analogous to optical flow, where an image is aligned to its temporally adjacent frame, we propose SIFT flow, a method to align an image to its nearest neighbors in a large image corpus containing a variety of scenes. The SIFT flow algorithm consists of matching densely sampled, pixelwise SIFT features between two images while preserving spatial discontinuities. The SIFT features allow robust matching across different scene/object appearances, whereas the discontinuity-preserving spatial model allows matching of objects located at different parts of the scene. Experiments show that the proposed approach robustly aligns complex scene pairs containing significant spatial differences. Based on SIFT flow, we propose an alignment-based large database framework for image analysis and synthesis, where image information is transferred from the nearest neighbors to a query image according to the dense scene correspondence. This framework is demonstrated through concrete applications such as motion field prediction from a single image, motion synthesis via object transfer, satellite image registration, and face recognition.},

abstract = {With the success of new computational architectures for visual processing, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) and access to image databases with millions of labeled examples (e.g., ImageNet, Places), the state of the art in computer vision is advancing rapidly. One important factor for continued progress is to understand the representations that are learned by the inner layers of these deep architectures. Here we show that object detectors emerge from training CNNs to perform scene classification. As scenes are composed of objects, the CNN for scene classification automatically discovers meaningful objects detectors, representative of the learned scene categories. With object detectors emerging as a result of learning to recognize scenes, our work demonstrates that the same network can perform both scene recognition and object localization in a single forward-pass, without ever having been explicitly taught the notion of objects.},

abstract = {The explosion of image data on the Internet has the potential to foster more sophisticated and robust models and algorithms to index, retrieve, organize and interact with images and multimedia data. But exactly how such data can be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. We introduce here a new database called {\&}{\#}x201C;ImageNet{\&}{\#}x201D;, a large-scale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 500-1000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering. We hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical structure of ImageNet can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond.},

abstract = {Retrieval tasks typically require a ranking of items given a query. Collaborative filtering tasks, on the other hand, learn to model user's preferences over items. In this paper we study the joint problem of recommending items to a user with respect to a given query, which is a surprisingly common task. This setup differs from the standard collaborative filtering one in that we are given a query x user x item tensor for training instead of the more traditional user x item matrix. Compared to document retrieval we do have a query, but we may or may not have content features (we will consider both cases) and we can also take account of the user's profile. We introduce a factorized model for this new task that optimizes the top-ranked items returned for the given query and user. We report empirical results where it outperforms several baselines.

In this paper we present one of our most recent initiatives in the areas of point cloud perception: PCL (Point Cloud Library - http://pointclouds.org). PCL presents an advanced and extensive approach to the subject of 3D perception, and it's meant to provide support for all the common 3D building blocks that applications need. The library contains state-of-the art algorithms for: filtering, feature estimation, surface reconstruction, registration, model fitting and segmentation. PCL is supported by an international community of robotics and perception researchers. We provide a brief walkthrough of PCL including its algorithmic capabilities and implementation strategies.},

abstract = {Acute liver failure is a rare multisystem disease that is characterised by the development of encephalopathy and coagulopathy within 26 weeks of the onset of symptoms in a patient with previously normal liver function. The commonest causes are viral hepatitis and acetaminophen overdose. The prognosis depends on the aetiology and the grade of encephalopathy at presentation. Because of the rapid evolution of the condition, early referral to a liver centre is important. Management is directed at the support of the cardiovascular system with volume replacement and inotropes. Continuous haemofiltration is used to manage renal failure and fluid balance. Hypoglycaemia is common and enteral nutrition should be started if possible. Patients with Grade III encephalopathy require tracheal intubation and ventilation. Cerebral oedema and raised intracranial pressure are present in more than 65{\%} of patients with Grade IV encephalopathy, and these patients should be sedated and nursed 300 head up, with minimal stimulation. Episodes of raised intracranial pressure should be treated with boluses of mannitol. Thiopentone infusions may be needed to control raised intracranial pressure, and the use of moderate hypothermia and hypertonic saline is being investigated. Intracranial pressure monitors are used in some centres, but carry a risk of cerebral bleeding because of the coagulopathy. Liver transplantation has a major role in the management, with 50{\%} of patients undergoing transplantation, and has improved outcome with survival rates of more than 65{\%} after transplantation. At present, artificial liver support systems have no role in the management of patients with acute liver failure.},

abstract = {Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

abstract = {When a large feedforward neural network is trained on a small training set, it typically performs poorly on held-out test data. This "overfitting" is greatly reduced by randomly omitting half of the feature detectors on each training case. This prevents complex co-adaptations in which a feature detector is only helpful in the context of several other specific feature detectors. Instead, each neuron learns to detect a feature that is generally helpful for producing the correct answer given the combinatorially large variety of internal contexts in which it must operate. Random "dropout" gives big improvements on many benchmark tasks and sets new records for speech and object recognition.},

abstract = {Artistic image understanding is an interdisciplinary research field of increasing importance for the computer vision and the art history communities. For computer vision scientists, this problem offers challenges where new techniques can be developed; and for the art history community new automatic art analysis tools can be developed. On the positive side, artistic images are generally constrained by compositional rules and artistic themes. However, the low-level texture and color features exploited for photographic image analysis are not as effective because of inconsistent color and texture patterns describing the visual classes in artistic images. In this work, we present a new database of monochromatic artistic images containing 988 images with a global semantic annotation, a local compositional annotation, and a pose annotation of human subjects and animal types. In total, 75 visual classes are annotated, from which 27 are related to the theme of the art image, and 48 are visual classes that can be localized in the image with bounding boxes. Out of these 48 classes, 40 have pose annotation, with 37 denoting human subjects and 3 representing animal types. We also provide a complete evaluation of several algorithms recently proposed for image annotation and retrieval. We then present an algorithm achieving remarkable performance over the most successful algorithm hitherto proposed for this problem. Our main goal with this paper is to make this database, the evaluation process, and the benchmark results available for the computer vision community.},

@article{Mathes1996,
abstract = {Despite advance radiotherapy techniques, long-term complications of radiation injury are still commonly seen. Acute effects are largely time dependent and can be controlled by alteration of therapy schedule. Chronic effects are dose dependent, and are associated with increased fibrosis and decreased vascularity which can lead to tissue necrosis, infection, and ulceration. The damaging effects of radiation therapy may not be clinically apparent for months or even years after treatment is given. The most commonly accepted theory explaining the effects of radiation injury on tissue healing has focused on decreased vascularity and hypoxia in affected tissues. More recently, impaired leukocyte function has been implicated as an additional factor in the pathophysiology of radiation injury. Reconstructive surgical plans may require alteration when operating in a radiated field, especially in the head and neck. Radiation wounds are best treated by standard, accepted techniques of thorough debridement and coverage with well-vascularized tissue. Hyperbaric oxygen may have a role in the management of early radiation injury or in prophylaxis against postoperative wound complications.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a technique for jointly quantizing continuous features and the posterior distributions of their class labels based on minimizing empirical information loss such that the quantizer index of a given feature vector approximates a sufficient statistic for its class label. Informally, the quantized representation retains as much information as possible for classifying the feature vector correctly. We derive an alternating minimization procedure for simultaneously learning codebooks in the euclidean feature space and in the simplex of posterior class distributions. The resulting quantizer can be used to encode unlabeled points outside the training set and to predict their posterior class distributions, and has an elegant interpretation in terms of lossless source coding. The proposed method is validated on synthetic and real data sets and is applied to two diverse problems: learning discriminative visual vocabularies for bag-of-features image classification and image segmentation.},

It is clinically characterized by pain in the eye (usually unilateral), headache, and blurring of vision. Signs include ciliary injection, hard and tender eye, fixed and dilated pupil unresponsive to bright light, hazy cornea, headache, nausea or vomiting, and markedly diminished vision.Keratitis is a breach of the corneal epithelium caused by infection, trauma, or impairment of the protective mechanism of the eye (e.g. lid malposition or tear deficiency). It is clinically characterized by a unilateral, painful, photophobic, injected eye; corneal ulceration (a dendritic ulcer indicates herpes simplex infection); ciliary injection; and altered vision},

In an effort to understand the benefits and drawbacks of existing methods, we empirically compare five state-of-the-art superpixel algorithms for their ability to adhere to image boundaries, speed, memory efficiency, and their impact on segmentation performance. We then introduce a new superpixel algorithm, simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC), which adapts a k-means clustering approach to efficiently generate superpixels. Despite its simplicity, SLIC adheres to boundaries as well as or better than previous methods. At the same time, it is faster and more memory efficient, improves segmentation performance, and is straightforward to extend to supervoxel generation.},

abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks define an exceptionally powerful class of models, but are still limited by the lack of ability to be spatially invariant to the input data in a computationally and parameter efficient manner. In this work we introduce a new learnable module, the Spatial Transformer, which explicitly allows the spatial manipulation of data within the network. This differentiable module can be inserted into existing convolutional architectures, giving neural networks the ability to actively spatially transform feature maps, conditional on the feature map itself, without any extra training supervision or modification to the optimisation process. We show that the use of spatial transformers results in models which learn invariance to translation, scale, rotation and more generic warping, resulting in state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, and for a number of classes of transformations.},

abstract = {Similarity indices for high-dimensional data are very desirable for building content-based search systems for feature-rich data such as audio, images, videos, and other sensor data. Recently, locality sensitive hashing (LSH) and its variations have been proposed as indexing techniques for approximate similarity search. A significant drawback of these approaches is the requirement for a large number of hash tables in order to achieve good search quality. This paper proposes a new indexing scheme called multi-probe LSH that overcomes this drawback. Multi-probe LSH is built on the well-known LSH technique, but it intelligently probes multiple buckets that are likely to contain query results in a hash table. Our method is inspired by and improves upon recent theoretical work on entropy-based LSH designed to reduce the space requirement of the basic LSH method. We have implemented the multi-probe LSH method and evaluated the implementation with two different high-dimensional datasets. Our evaluation shows that the multi-probe LSH method substantially improves upon previously proposed methods in both space and time efficiency. To achieve the same search quality, multi-probe LSH has a similar time-efficiency as the basic LSH method while reducing the number of hash tables by an order of magnitude. In comparison with the entropy-based LSH method, to achieve the same search quality, multi-probe LSH uses less query time and 5 to 8 times fewer number of hash tables.},

abstract = {We present a method for detecting objects in images using a single deep neural network. Our approach, named SSD, discretizes the output space of bounding boxes into a set of default boxes over different aspect ratios and scales per feature map location. At prediction time, the network generates scores for the presence of each object category in each default box and produces adjustments to the box to better match the object shape. Additionally, the network combines predictions from multiple feature maps with different resolutions to naturally handle objects of various sizes. Our SSD model is simple relative to methods that require object proposals because it completely eliminates proposal generation and subsequent pixel or feature resampling stage and encapsulates all computation in a single network. This makes SSD easy to train and straightforward to integrate into systems that require a detection component. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC, MS COCO, and ILSVRC datasets confirm that SSD has comparable accuracy to methods that utilize an additional object proposal step and is much faster, while providing a unified framework for both training and inference. Compared to other single stage methods, SSD has much better accuracy, even with a smaller input image size. For {\$}300\backslashtimes 300{\$} input, SSD achieves 72.1{\%} mAP on VOC2007 test at 58 FPS on a Nvidia Titan X and for {\$}500\backslashtimes 500{\$} input, SSD achieves 75.1{\%} mAP, outperforming a comparable state of the art Faster R-CNN model.

abstract = {Informative image representations are important in achieving state-of-the-art performance in object recogni- tion tasks. Among feature learning algorithms that are used to develop image representations, restricted Boltzmann ma- chines (RBMs) have good expressive power and build ef- fective representations. However, the difficulty of training RBMs has been a barrier to their wide use. To address this difficulty, we show the connections between mixture mod- els and RBMs and present an efficient training method for RBMs that utilize these connections. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work showing that RBMs can be trained with almost no hyperparameter tuning to provide classification performance similar to or significantly bet- ter than mixture models (e.g., Gaussian mixture models). Along with this efficient training, we evaluate the impor- tance of convolutional training that can capture a larger spatial context with less redundancy, as compared to non- convolutional training. Overall, our method achieves state- of-the-art performance on both Caltech 101 / 256 datasets using a single type of feature. 1.},

abstract = {Purpose Of review: To encapsulate the recent developments in endoscopic procedural sedation from the standpoints of safety, efficacy and policy. Recent findings: Initial studies addressing the presence of obstructive sleep apnea in patients undergoing upper endoscopy and colonoscopy did not find an increased risk of cardiopulmonary complications. A worldwide study of 646 080 patients receiving endoscopist-directed propofol sedation found a mortality rate of one per 161 515 cases, which all occurred in patients with high-risk comorbidities. The incidence of bag mask ventilation was significantly higher for upper endoscopy when compared to colonoscopy (185/185 245; 0.1{\%} vs. 20/142 863, 0.01{\%}; P {\textless} 0.001). Summary: The presence of obstructive sleep apnea whether diagnosed by a surrogate validated questionnaire to by the gold standard sleep study does not appear to lead to increased rates of hypoxemia in patients undergoing ambulatory upper endoscopy. Endoscopist-directed propofol sedation is well tolerated in the appropriately selected patient. The use of anesthesia-assisted sedation for American Society of Anesthesiologists class I and II patients for upper endoscopy and colonoscopy is cost-ineffective. {\textcopyright} 2010 Wolters Kluwer Health Lippincott Williams {\&} Wilkins.},

abstract = {The repeatability and efficiency of a corner detector determines how likely it is to be useful in a real-world application. The repeatability is important because the same scene viewed from different positions should yield features which correspond to the same real-world 3D locations. The efficiency is important because this determines whether the detector combined with further processing can operate at frame rate. Three advances are described in this paper. First, we present a new heuristic for feature detection and, using machine learning, we derive a feature detector from this which can fully process live PAL video using less than 5 percent of the available processing time. By comparison, most other detectors cannot even operate at frame rate (Harris detector 115 percent, SIFT 195 percent). Second, we generalize the detector, allowing it to be optimized for repeatability, with little loss of efficiency. Third, we carry out a rigorous comparison of corner detectors based on the above repeatability criterion applied to 3D scenes. We show that, despite being principally constructed for speed, on these stringent tests, our heuristic detector significantly outperforms existing feature detectors. Finally, the comparison demonstrates that using machine learning produces significant improvements in repeatability, yielding a detector that is both very fast and of very high quality.},

abstract = {Face identification is the problem of determining whether two face images depict the same person or not. This is difficult due to variations in scale, pose, lighting, background, expression, hairstyle, and glasses. In this paper we present two methods for learning robust distance measures: (a) a logistic discriminant approach which learns the metric from a set of labelled image pairs (LDML) and (b) a nearest neighbour approach which computes the probability for two images to belong to the same class (MkNN). We evaluate our approaches on the Labeled Faces in the Wild data set, a large and very challenging data set of faces from Yahoo! News. The evaluation protocol for this data set defines a restricted setting, where a fixed set of positive and negative image pairs is given, as well as an unrestricted one, where faces are labelled by their identity. We are the first to present results for the unrestricted setting, and show that our methods benefit from this richer training data, much more so than the current state-of-the-art method. Our results of 79.3{\%} and 87.5{\%} correct for the restricted and unrestricted setting respectively, significantly improve over the current state-of-the-art result of 78.5{\%}. Confidence scores obtained for face identification can be used for many applications e.g. clustering or recognition from a single training example. We show that our learned metrics also improve performance for these tasks.},

abstract = {Obesity is increasing in an epidemic manner in most countries and constitutes a public health problem by enhancing the risk for cardiovascular disease and metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes. Owing to the increase in obesity, life expectancy may start to decrease in developed countries for the first time in recent history. The factors determining fat mass in adult humans are not fully understood, but increased lipid storage in already developed fat cells (adipocytes) is thought to be most important. Here we show that adipocyte number is a major determinant for the fat mass in adults. However, the number of fat cells stays constant in adulthood in lean and obese individuals, even after marked weight loss, indicating that the number of adipocytes is set during childhood and adolescence. To establish the dynamics within the stable population of adipocytes in adults, we have measured adipocyte turnover by analysing the integration of 14C derived from nuclear bomb tests in genomic DNA. Approximately 10{\%} of fat cells are renewed annually at all adult ages and levels of body mass index. Neither adipocyte death nor generation rate is altered in early onset obesity, suggesting a tight regulation of fat cell number in this condition during adulthood. The high turnover of adipocytes establishes a new therapeutic target for pharmacological intervention in obesity.},

In particular we derive and analyze algorithms for binary and multiclass categorization, regression, uniclass prediction and sequence prediction. The update steps of our different algorithms are all based on analytical solutions to simple constrained optimization problems. This unified view al-lows us to prove worst-case loss bounds for the different algorithms and for the various decision problems based on a single lemma. Our bounds on the cumulative loss of the algorithms are relative to the smallest loss that can be attained by any fixed hypothesis, and as such are applicable to both realizable and unrealizable settings. We demonstrate some of the merits of the proposed algorithms in a series of experiments with synthetic and real data sets.},

abstract = {Training object class detectors typically requires a large set of images in which objects are annotated by bounding-boxes. However, manually drawing bounding-boxes is very time consuming. We propose a new scheme for training object detectors which only requires annotators to verify bounding-boxes produced automatically by the learning algorithm. Our scheme iterates between re-training the detector, re-localizing objects in the training images, and human verification. We use the verification signal both to improve re-training and to reduce the search space for re-localisation, which makes these steps different to what is normally done in a weakly supervised setting. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2007 show that (1) using human verification to update detectors and reduce the search space leads to the rapid production of high-quality bounding-box annotations; (2) our scheme delivers detectors performing almost as good as those trained in a fully supervised setting, without ever drawing any bounding-box; (3) as the verification task is very quick, our scheme substantially reduces total annotation time by a factor 6x-9x.},

abstract = {CO is an ubiquitous poison with many sources of exposure. CO poisoning produces diverse signs and symptoms that are often subtle and may be easily misdiagnosed. Failure to diagnose CO poisoning may result insignificant morbidity and mortality and permit continued exposure to a dangerous environment. Treatment of CO poisoning begins with inhalation of supplemental oxygen and aggressive supportive care. HBOT accelerates dissociation of CO from hemoglobin and may also prevent DNS. Absolute indications forHBOT for CO poisoning remain controversial, although most authors would agree that HBOT is indicated in patients who are comatose or neurologically abnormal, have a history of LOC with their exposure, or have cardiac dysfunction. Pregnancy with an elevated CO-Hgb level({\textgreater}15{\%}-20{\%}) is also widely, considered an indication for treatment.HBOT may be considered in patients who have persistent symptoms despite NBO, metabolic acidosis, abnormalities on neuropsychometric testing, or significantly elevated levels. The ideal regimen of oxygen therapy has yet to be determined, and significant controversy exists regarding HBOTtreatment protocols. Often the local medical toxicologist, poison control center, or hyperbaric unit may assist the treating physician with decisions regarding therapy.},

abstract = {Fig. 1. Image completion results by our approach. The masked area is shown in white. Our approach can generate novel fragments that are not present elsewhere in the image, such as needed for completing faces; this is not possible with patch-based methods. We present a novel approach for image completion that results in images that are both locally and globally consistent. With a fully-convolutional neural network, we can complete images of arbitrary resolutions by in missing regions of any shape. To train this image completion network to be consistent, we use global and local context discriminators that are trained to distinguish real images from completed ones. The global discriminator looks at the entire image to assess if it is coherent as a whole, while the local discriminator looks only at a small area centered at the completed region to ensure the local consistency of the generated patches. The image completion network is then trained to fool the both context discriminator networks, which requires it to generate images that are indistinguishable from real ones with regard to overall consistency as well as in details. We show that our approach can be used to complete a wide variety of scenes. Furthermore, in contrast with the patch-based approaches such as PatchMatch, our approach can generate fragments that do not appear elsewhere in the image, which allows us to naturally complete the images of objects with familiar and highly speciic structures, such as faces.},

We show that interesting dictionaries can be learned for interactions that encode tree structures or locally connected structures. Finally, we show that our framework allows us to learn the values of the interactions from the data, rather than having them pre-specified. 1},

abstract = {The design of low-level image features is critical for computer vision algorithms. Orientation histograms, such as those in SIFT and HOG, are the most successful and popular features for visual object and scene recognition. We highlight the kernel view of orientation histograms, and show that they are equivalent to a certain type of match kernels over image patches. This novel view allows us to design a family of kernel descriptors which provide a unified and principled framework to turn pixel attributes (gradient, color, local binary pattern, etc.) into compact patch-level features. In particular, we introduce three types of match kernels to measure similarities between image patches, and construct compact low-dimensional kernel descriptors from these match kernels using kernel principal component analysis (KPCA). Kernel descriptors are easy to design and can turn any type of pixel attribute into patch-level features. They outperform carefully tuned and sophisticated features including SIFT and deep belief networks. We report superior performance on standard image classification benchmarks: Scene-15, Caltech-101, CIFAR10 and CIFAR10-ImageNet.},

abstract = { Matching points between multiple images of a scene is a vital component of many computer vision tasks. Point matching involves creating a succinct and discriminative descriptor for each point. While current descriptors such as SIFT can find matches between features with unique local neighborhoods, these descriptors typically fail to consider global context to resolve ambiguities that can occur locally when an image has multiple similar regions. This paper presents a feature descriptor that augments SIFT with a global context vector that adds curvilinear shape information from a much larger neighborhood, thus reducing mismatches when multiple local descriptors are similar. It also provides a more robust method for handling 2D nonrigid transformations since points are more effectively matched individually at a global scale rather than constraining multiple matched points to be mapped via a planar homography. We have tested our technique on various images and compare matching accuracy between the SIFT descriptor with global context to that without.},

abstract = {Computer vision has grown tremendously in the past two decades. Despite all efforts, existing attempts at matching parts of the human visual system's extraordinary ability to understand visual scenes lack either scope or power. By combining the advantages of general low-level generative models and powerful layer-based and hierarchical models, this work aims at being a first step toward richer, more flexible models of images. After comparing various types of restricted Baltzman machines (RBMs) able to model continuous-valued data, we introduce our basic model, the masked RBM, which explicitly models occlusion boundaries in image patches by factoring the appearance of any patch region from its shape. We then propose a generative model of larger images using a field of such RBMs. Finally, we discuss how masked RBMs could be stacked to form a deep model able to generate more complicated structures and suitable for various tasks such as segmentation or object recognition.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel image classification scheme for benthic coral reef images that can be applied to both single image and composite mosaic datasets. The proposed method can be configured to the characteristics (e.g., the size of the dataset, number of classes, resolution of the samples, color information availability, class types, etc.) of individual datasets. The proposed method uses completed local binary pattern (CLBP), grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), Gabor filter response, and opponent angle and hue channel color histograms as feature descriptors. For classification, either k- nearest neighbor (KNN), neural network (NN), support vector machine (SVM) or probability density weighted mean distance (PDWMD) is used. The combination of features and classifiers that attains the best results is presented together with the guidelines for selection. The accuracy and efficiency of our proposed method are compared with other state-of-the-art techniques using three benthic and three texture datasets. The proposed method achieves the highest overall classification accuracy of any of the tested methods and has moderate execution time.

abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57{\%} error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28{\%} relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC {\&} COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

abstract = {In this paper we investigate the error criteria that are optimized during the training of artificial neural networks (ANN). We compare the bounds of the squared error (SE) and the crossentropy (CE) criteria being the most popular choices in stateof- The art implementations. The evaluation is performed on automatic speech recognition (ASR) and handwriting recognition (HWR) tasks using a hybrid HMM-ANN model. We find that with randomly initialized weights, the squared error based ANN does not converge to a good local optimum. However, with a good initialization by pre-training, the word error rate of our best CE trained system could be reduced from 30.9{\%} to 30.5{\%} on the ASR, and from 22.7{\%} to 21.9{\%} on the HWR task by performing a few additional "fine-tuning" iterations with the SE criterion.

@article{Wu2010,
abstract = {The Bag-of-Words (BoW) model is a promising image representation technique for image categorization and annotation tasks. One critical limitation of existing BoW models is that much semantic information is lost during the codebook generation process, an important step of BoW. This is because the codebook generated by BoW is often obtained via building the codebook simply by clustering visual features in Euclidian space. However, visual features related to the same semantics may not distribute in clusters in the Euclidian space, which is primarily due to the semantic gap between low-level features and high-level semantics. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme to learn optimized BoW models, which aims to map semantically related features to the same visual words. In particular, we consider the distance between semantically identical features as a measurement of the semantic gap, and attempt to learn an optimized codebook by minimizing this gap, aiming to achieve the minimal loss of the semantics. We refer to such kind of novel codebook as semantics-preserving codebook (SPC) and the corresponding model as the Semantics-Preserving Bag-of-Words (SPBoW) model. Extensive experiments on image annotation and object detection tasks with public testbeds from MIT's Labelme and PASCAL VOC challenge databases show that the proposed SPC learning scheme is effective for optimizing the codebook generation process, and the SPBoW model is able to greatly enhance the performance of the existing BoW model.},

abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it has come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting-the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie wrote much of the statistical modeling software in S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the Lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, and projection pursuit. FROM THE REVIEWS: TECHNOMETRICS "This is a vast and complex book. Generally, it concentrates on explaining why and how the methods work, rather than how to use them. Examples and especially the visualizations are principle features...As a source for the methods of statistical learning...it will probably be a long time before there is a competitor to this book."},

abstract = {B-cell lymphoma 3 (Bcl3) is a proto-oncogene upregulated in a wide range of cancers, including breast cancer. Although Bcl3 is known to promote cell proliferation and inhibit apoptosis, the molecular mechanisms underlying the proto-oncogenic function of Bcl3 have not been completely elucidated. To gain insight into the oncogenic role of Bcl3, we applied a proteomic approach, which led to the identification of C-terminal binding protein 1 (CtBP1) as a binding partner of Bcl3. A PXDLS/R motif embedded in Bcl3 was found to mediate the interaction between Bcl3 and CtBP1, which caused the stabilization of CtBP1 by blocking proteasome-dependent degradation. Apoptotic stimuli-induced degradation of CtBP1 was significantly abolished by the upregulation of Bcl3, leading to the sustained repression of pro-apoptotic gene expression and subsequent inhibition of apoptosis. Intriguingly, a strong positive correlation between the protein levels of Bcl3 and CtBP1 was detected in breast cancer patient samples. Our study reveals a novel combinatorial role for Bcl3 and CtBP1, providing an explanation for the acquisition of resistance to apoptosis in cancer cells, which is a major requirement for cancer development.},

abstract = {This paper considers and solves the problem of estimating camera pose given a pair of point-tangent correspondences between the 3D scene and the projected image. The problem arises when considering curve geometry as the basis of forming correspondences, computation of structure and calibration, which in its simplest form is a point augmented with the curve tangent. We show that while the standard resectioning problem is solved with a minimum of three points given the intrinsic parameters, when points are augmented with tangent information only two points are required, leading to substantial computational savings, e.g., when used as a minimal engine within a RANSAC strategy. In ad- dition, computational algorithms are developed to find a practical and efficient solution which is shown to effectively recover camera pose using synthetic and realistic datasets. The resolution of this problem is intended as a basic building block of future curve-based structure from motion systems, allowing new views to be incrementally registered to a core set of views for which relative pose has already been computed.},

We first present and evaluate different ways of aggregating local image descriptors into a vector and show that the Fisher kernel achieves better performance than the reference bag-of-visual words approach for any given vector dimension. We then jointly optimize dimensionality reduction and indexing in order to obtain a precise vector comparison as well as a compact representation. The evaluation shows that the image representation can be reduced to a few dozen bytes while preserving high accuracy. Searching a 100 million image dataset takes about 250 ms on one processor core.},

@article{Coquelin2007,
abstract = {Bandit based methods for tree search have recently gained popularity when applied to huge trees, e.g. in the game of go (Gelly et al., 2006). The UCT algorithm (Kocsis and Szepesvari, 2006), a tree search method based on Upper Confidence Bounds (UCB) (Auer et al., 2002), is believed to adapt locally to the effective smoothness of the tree. However, we show that UCT is too ``optimistic'' in some cases, leading to a regret O(exp(exp(D))) where D is the depth of the tree. We propose alternative bandit algorithms for tree search. First, a modification of UCT using a confidence sequence that scales exponentially with the horizon depth is proven to have a regret O(2 D sqrtn), but does not adapt to possible smoothness in the tree. We then analyze Flat-UCB performed on the leaves and provide a finite regret bound with high probability. Then, we introduce a UCB-based Bandit Algorithm for Smooth Trees which takes into account actual smoothness of the rewards for performing efficient ``cuts'' of sub-optimal branches with high confidence. Finally, we present an incremental tree search version which applies when the full tree is too big (possibly infinite) to be entirely represented and show that with high probability, essentially only the optimal branches is indefinitely developed. We illustrate these methods on a global optimization problem of a Lipschitz function, given noisy data.},

It has been shown that these networks still work well when they are applied to datasets or recognition tasks different from those they were trained on. However, descriptors like SIFT are not only used in recognition but also for many correspondence problems that rely on descriptor matching. In this paper we compare features from various layers of convolutional neural nets to standard SIFT descriptors. We consider a network that was trained on ImageNet and another one that was trained without supervision. Surprisingly, convolutional neural networks clearly outperform SIFT on descriptor matching.},

abstract = {In this paper we are concerned with the optimal combination of features of possibly different types for detection and estimation tasks in machine vision. We propose to combine features such that the resulting classifier maximizes the margin between classes. In$\backslash$ncontrast to existing approaches which are non-convex and/or generative we propose to use a discriminative model leading to convex problem formulation and complexity control.$\backslash$nFurthermore we assert that decision functions should not compare apples and oranges by comparing features of different types directly. Instead we propose to combine different similarity measures for each different$\backslash$nfeature type. Furthermore we argue that the question: Which feature type is more discriminative for task X? is ill-posed and show empirically that the answer to this question might depend on the complexity of the decision function.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a method for learning class-specific features for recognition. Recently a greedy layer-wise procedure was proposed to initialize weights of deep belief networks, by viewing each layer as a separate restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM). We develop the convolutional RBM (C-RBM), a variant of the RBM model in which weights are shared to respect the spatial structure of images. This framework learns a set of features that can generate the images of a specific object class. Our feature extraction model is a four layer hierarchy of alternating filtering and maximum subsampling. We learn feature parameters of the first and third layers viewing them as separate C-RBMs. The outputs of our feature extraction hierarchy are then fed as input to a discriminative classifier. It is experimentally demonstrated that the extracted features are effective for object detection, using them to obtain performance comparable to the state of the art on handwritten digit recognition and pedestrian detection.},

abstract = {Training object class detectors typically requires a large set of images in which objects are annotated by bounding-boxes. However, manually drawing bounding-boxes is very time consuming. We propose a new scheme for training object detectors which only requires annotators to verify bounding-boxes produced automatically by the learning algorithm. Our scheme iterates between re-training the detector, re-localizing objects in the training images, and human verification. We use the verification signal both to improve re-training and to reduce the search space for re-localisation, which makes these steps different to what is normally done in a weakly supervised setting. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2007 show that (1) using human verification to update detectors and reduce the search space leads to the rapid production of high-quality bounding-box annotations; (2) our scheme delivers detectors performing almost as good as those trained in a fully supervised setting, without ever drawing any bounding-box; (3) as the verification task is very quick, our scheme substantially reduces total annotation time by a factor 6x-9x.},

abstract = {In this paper we address the following question: Can we approximately sample from a Bayesian posterior distribution if we are only allowed to touch a small mini-batch of data-items for every sample we generate?. An algorithm based on the Langevin equation with stochastic gradients (SGLD) was previously proposed to solve this, but its mixing rate was slow. By leveraging the Bayesian Central Limit Theorem, we extend the SGLD algorithm so that at high mixing rates it will sample from a normal approximation of the posterior, while for slow mixing rates it will mimic the behavior of SGLD with a pre-conditioner matrix. As a bonus, the proposed algorithm is reminiscent of Fisher scoring (with stochastic gradients) and as such an efficient optimizer during burn-in.},

abstract = {The objective of this paper is large scale object instance retrieval, given a query image. A starting point of such systems is feature detection and description, for example using SIFT. The focus of this paper, however, is towards very large scale retrieval where, due to storage requirements, very compact image descriptors are required and no information about the original SIFT descriptors can be accessed directly at run time. We start from VLAD, the state-of-the art compact descriptor introduced by Jegou et al. for this purpose, and make three novel contributions: first, we show that a simple change to the normalization method significantly improves retrieval performance, second, we show that vocabulary adaptation can substantially alleviate problems caused when images are added to the dataset after initial vocabulary learning. These two methods set a new state-of-the-art over all benchmarks investigated here for both mid-dimensional (20k-D to 30k-D) and small (128-D) descriptors. Our third contribution is a multiple spatial VLAD representation, MultiVLAD, that allows the retrieval and localization of objects that only extend over a small part of an image (again without requiring use of the original image SIFT descriptors).

abstract = {Image category recognition is important to access visual information on the level of objects and scene types. So far, intensity-based descriptors have been widely used for feature extraction at salient points. To increase illumination invariance and discriminative power, color descriptors have been proposed. Because many different descriptors exist, a structured overview is required of color invariant descriptors in the context of image category recognition. Therefore, this paper studies the invariance properties and the distinctiveness of color descriptors (software to compute the color descriptors from this paper is available from http://www.colordescriptors.com) in a structured way. The analytical invariance properties of color descriptors are explored, using a taxonomy based on invariance properties with respect to photometric transformations, and tested experimentally using a data set with known illumination conditions. In addition, the distinctiveness of color descriptors is assessed experimentally using two benchmarks, one from the image domain and one from the video domain. From the theoretical and experimental results, it can be derived that invariance to light intensity changes and light color changes affects category recognition. The results further reveal that, for light intensity shifts, the usefulness of invariance is category-specific. Overall, when choosing a single descriptor and no prior knowledge about the data set and object and scene categories is available, the OpponentSIFT is recommended. Furthermore, a combined set of color descriptors outperforms intensity-based SIFT and improves category recognition by 8 percent on the PASCAL VOC 2007 and by 7 percent on the Mediamill Challenge.},

Today we are witnessing the birth of a new generation of sensing technologies capable of providing high quality synchronized videos of both color and depth, the RGB-D (Kinect-style) camera. With its advanced sensing capabilities and the potential for mass adoption, this technology represents an opportunity to dramatically increase robotic object recognition, manipulation, navigation, and interaction capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale, hierarchical multi-view object dataset collected using an RGB-D camera. The dataset contains 300 objects organized into 51 categories and has been made publicly available to the research community so as to enable rapid progress based on this promising technology. This paper describes the dataset collection procedure and introduces techniques for RGB-D based object recognition and detection, demonstrating that combining color and depth information substantially improves quality of results.},

abstract = {Unsupervised discovery of latent representations, in addition to being useful for density modeling, visualisation and exploratory data analysis, is also increasingly important for learning features relevant to discriminative tasks. Autoencoders, in particular, have proven to be an effective way to learn latent codes that reflect meaningful variations in data. A continuing challenge, however, is guiding an autoencoder toward representations that are useful for particular discriminative tasks. A complementary challenge is to find codes that are explicitly invariant to irrelevant transformations of the data. To address these difficulties, we introduce the semiparametric latent variable model (SPLVM), which combines an autoencoder with a Gaussian process latent variable model. The SPLVM enables an autoencoder's unsupervised representation to both incorporate relevant label information and ignore irrelevant variations. We apply this model to several different datasets, examining how both labels and nuisance variables can provide cues for useful latent representations.},

Abstract Popular sites like Houzz, Pinterest, and LikeThatDecor, have com-munities of users helping each other answer questions about products in images. In this paper we learn an embedding for visual search in interior design. Our embedding contains two different domains of product images: products cropped from internet scenes, and prod-ucts in their iconic form. With such a multi-domain embedding, we demonstrate several applications of visual search including identify-ing products in scenes and finding stylistically similar products. To obtain the embedding, we train a convolutional neural network on pairs of images. We explore several training architectures including re-purposing object classifiers, using siamese networks, and using multitask learning. We evaluate our search quantitatively and qualita-tively and demonstrate high quality results for search across multiple visual domains, enabling new applications in interior design.},

abstract = {Recognizing arbitrary multi-character text in unconstrained natural photographs is a hard problem. In this paper, we address an equally hard sub-problem in this domain viz. recognizing arbitrary multi-digit numbers from Street View imagery. Traditional approaches to solve this problem typically separate out the localization, segmentation, and recognition steps. In this paper we propose a unified approach that integrates these three steps via the use of a deep convolutional neural network that operates directly on the image pixels. We employ the DistBelief implementation of deep neural networks in order to train large, distributed neural networks on high quality images. We find that the performance of this approach increases with the depth of the convolutional network, with the best performance occurring in the deepest architecture we trained, with eleven hidden layers. We evaluate this approach on the publicly available SVHN dataset and achieve over {\$}96\backslash{\%}{\$} accuracy in recognizing complete street numbers. We show that on a per-digit recognition task, we improve upon the state-of-the-art, achieving {\$}97.84\backslash{\%}{\$} accuracy. We also evaluate this approach on an even more challenging dataset generated from Street View imagery containing several tens of millions of street number annotations and achieve over {\$}90\backslash{\%}{\$} accuracy. To further explore the applicability of the proposed system to broader text recognition tasks, we apply it to synthetic distorted text from reCAPTCHA. reCAPTCHA is one of the most secure reverse turing tests that uses distorted text to distinguish humans from bots. We report a {\$}99.8\backslash{\%}{\$} accuracy on the hardest category of reCAPTCHA. Our evaluations on both tasks indicate that at specific operating thresholds, the performance of the proposed system is comparable to, and in some cases exceeds, that of human operators.},

abstract = {Recent results indicate that the generic descriptors extracted from the convolutional neural networks are very powerful. This paper adds to the mounting evidence that this is indeed the case. We report on a series of experiments conducted for different recognition tasks using the publicly available code and model of the $\backslash$overfeat network which was trained to perform object classification on ILSVRC13. We use features extracted from the $\backslash$overfeat network as a generic image representation to tackle the diverse range of recognition tasks of object image classification, scene recognition, fine grained recognition, attribute detection and image retrieval applied to a diverse set of datasets. We selected these tasks and datasets as they gradually move further away from the original task and data the $\backslash$overfeat network was trained to solve. Astonishingly, we report consistent superior results compared to the highly tuned state-of-the-art systems in all the visual classification tasks on various datasets. For instance retrieval it consistently outperforms low memory footprint methods except for sculptures dataset. The results are achieved using a linear SVM classifier (or {\$}L2{\$} distance in case of retrieval) applied to a feature representation of size 4096 extracted from a layer in the net. The representations are further modified using simple augmentation techniques e.g. jittering. The results strongly suggest that features obtained from deep learning with convolutional nets should be the primary candidate in most visual recognition tasks.},

abstract = {Theoretical results suggest that in order to learn the kind of complicated functions that can represent high-level abstractions (e.g., in vision, language, and other AI-level tasks), one may need deep architectures. Deep architectures are composed of multiple levels of non-linear operations, such as in neural nets with many hidden layers or in complicated propositional formulae re-using many sub-formulae. Searching the parameter space of deep architectures is a difficult task, but learning algorithms such as those for Deep Belief Networks have recently been proposed to tackle this problem with notable success, beating the state-of-the-art in certain areas. This monograph discusses the motivations and principles regarding learning algorithms for deep architectures, in particular those exploiting as building blocks unsupervised learning of single-layer models such as Restricted Boltzmann Machines, used to construct deeper models such as Deep Belief Networks.},

abstract = {Deep learning methods have typically been trained on large datasets in which many training examples are available. However, many real-world product datasets have only a small number of images available for each product. We explore the use of deep learning methods for recognizing object instances when we have only a single training example per class. We show that feedforward neural networks outperform state-of-the-art methods for recognizing objects from novel viewpoints even when trained from just a single image per object. To further improve our performance on this task, we propose to take advantage of a supplementary dataset in which we observe a separate set of objects from multiple viewpoints. We introduce a new approach for training deep learning methods for instance recognition with limited training data, in which we use an auxiliary multi-view dataset to train our network to be robust to viewpoint changes. We find that this approach leads to a more robust classifier for recognizing objects from novel viewpoints, outperforming previous state-of-the-art approaches including keypoint-matching, template-based techniques, and sparse coding.},

Even though the integer model is widely used in theoretical computer science, the real number model is more useful for estimating an algorithm's running time in actual computation. Although the ellipsoid algorithm is a polynomial-time algorithm in the integer model, we prove that it has unbounded complexity in the real number model. We conjecture that there exists no polynomial-time algorithm for the linear inequalities problem in the real number model. We also conjecture that linear inequalities are strictly harder than linear equalities in all "reasonable" models of computation. ?? 1982.},

abstract = {Fine-grained recognition is challenging mainly because the inter-class differences between fine-grained classes are usually local and subtle while intra-class differences could be large due to pose variations. In order to distinguish them from intra-class variations, it is essential to zoom in on highly discriminative local regions. In this work, we introduce a reinforcement learning-based fully convolutional attention localization network to adaptively select multiple task-driven visual attention regions. We show that zooming in on the selected attention regions significantly improves the performance of fine-grained recognition. Compared to previous reinforcement learning-based models, the proposed approach is noticeably more computationally efficient during both training and testing because of its fully-convolutional architecture, and it is capable of simultaneous focusing its glimpse on multiple visual attention regions. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves notably higher classification accuracy on three benchmark fine-grained recognition datasets: Stanford Dogs, Stanford Cars, and CUB-200-2011.},

abstract = {Object cutout is a fundamental operation for image editing and manipulation, yet it is extremely challenging to automate it in real-world images, which typically contain considerable background clutter. In contrast to existing cutout methods, which are based mainly on low-level image analysis, we propose a more holistic approach, which considers the entire shape of the object of interest by leveraging higher-level image analysis and learnt global shape priors. Specifically, we leverage a deep neural network (DNN) trained for objects of a particular class (chairs) for realizing this mechanism. Given a rectangular image region, the DNN outputs a probability map (P-map) that indicates for each pixel inside the rectangle how likely it is to be contained inside an object from the class of interest. We show that the resulting P-maps may be used to evaluate how likely a rectangle proposal is to contain an instance of the class, and further process good proposals to produce an accurate object cutout mask. This amounts to an automatic end-to-end pipeline for catergory-specific object cutout. We evaluate our approach on segmentation benchmark datasets, and show that it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on them.},

abstract = {When modeling high-dimensional richly structured data, it is often the case that the distribution defined by the Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM) has a rough energy landscape with many local minima that are separated by high energy barriers. The commonly used Gibbs sampler tends to get trapped in one local mode, which often results in unstable learning dynamics and leads to poor parameter estimates. In this paper, we concentrate on learning DBM's using adaptive MCMC algorithms. We first show a close connection between Fast PCD and adaptive MCMC. We then develop a Coupled Adaptive Simulated Tempering algorithm that can be used to better explore a highly multimodal energy landscape. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm considerably improves parameter estimates, particularly when learning large-scale DBM's.},

Incorporating semantics and motion enhances the overall perception of the dynamic scene. For applications of outdoor robotic navigation, joint learning methods have not been extensively used for extracting spatio-temporal features or adding different priors into the formulation. The task becomes even more challenging without stereo information being incorporated. This paper proposes an approach to fuse semantic features and motion clues using CNNs, to address the problem of monocular semantic motion segmentation. We deduce semantic and motion labels by integrating optical flow as a constraint with semantic features into dilated convolution network. The pipeline consists of three main stages i.e Feature extraction, Feature amplification and Multi Scale Context Aggregation to fuse the semantics and flow features. Our joint formulation shows significant improvements in monocular motion segmentation over the state of the art methods on challenging KITTI tracking dataset.},

@article{Petersen2013,
abstract = {Papers on functional language implementations frequently set the goal of achieving performance “comparable to C”, and sometimes report results comparing benchmark results to concrete C imple- mentations of the same problem. A key pair of questions for such comparisons is: what C program to compare to, and what C com- piler to compare with? In a 2012 paper, Satish et al [9] compare naive serial C implementations of a range of throughput-oriented benchmarks to best-optimized implementations parallelized on a six-core machine and demonstrate an average 23× (up to 53×) speedup. Further, they demonstrate that most of this so-called “Ninja-gap” between naive C and best-optimized code can be elim- inated using relatively straightforward C programming techniques. Even accounting for thread parallel speedup, these results demon- strate a substantial performance gap between naive and tuned C code. In this paper we choose a subset of the benchmarks studied by Satish et al to port to Haskell.We measure performance of these Haskell benchmarks compiled with the standard Glasgow Haskell Compiler and with our experimental Intel Labs Haskell Research Compiler and report results as compared to our best reconstruc- tions of the algorithms used by Satish et al. Results are reported as measured both on an Intel Xeon E5-4650 32-core machine, and on an Intel Xeon Phi co-processor. We hope that this study provides valuable data on the concrete performance of Haskell relative to C.},

We consider this problem in a bag of features like setting and propose a new, learned, local feature descriptor for RGB-D images, the convolutional k-means descriptor. The descriptor is based on recent results from the machine learning community. It automatically learns feature responses in the neighborhood of detected interest points and is able to combine all avail- able information, such as color and depth into one, concise representation. To demonstrate the strength of this approach we show its applicability to different recognition problems. We evaluate the quality of the descriptor on the RGB-D Object Dataset where it is competitive with previously published results and propose an embedding into an image processing pipeline for object recognition and pose estimation.},

abstract = {Recognizing possibly thousands of objects is a crucial capability for an autonomous agent to understand and interact with everyday environments. Practical object recognition comes in multiple forms: Is this a coffee mug? (category recognition). Is this Alice's coffee mug? (instance recognition). Is the mug with the handle fac- ing left or right? (pose recognition). We present a scal- able framework, Object-Pose Tree, which efficiently or- ganizes data into a semantically structured tree. The tree structure enables both scalable training and test- ing, allowing us to solve recognition over thousands of object poses in near real-time. Moreover, by simulta- neously optimizing all three tasks, our approach out- performs standard nearest neighbor and 1-vs-all clas- sifications, with large improvements on pose recogni- tion. We evaluate the proposed technique on a dataset of 300 household objects collected using a Kinect-style 3D camera. Experiments demonstrate that our system achieves robust and efficient object category, instance, and pose recognition on challenging everyday objects.},

abstract = {One of recent trends [30, 31, 14] in network architec- ture design is stacking small filters (e.g., 1x1 or 3x3) in the entire network because the stacked small filters is more ef- ficient than a large kernel, given the same computational complexity. However, in the field of semantic segmenta- tion, where we need to perform dense per-pixel prediction, we find that the large kernel (and effective receptive field) plays an important role when we have to perform the clas- sification and localization tasks simultaneously. Following our design principle, we propose a Global Convolutional Network to address both the classification and localization issues for the semantic segmentation. We also suggest a residual-based boundary refinement to further refine the ob- ject boundaries. Our approach achieves state-of-art perfor- mance on two public benchmarks and significantly outper- forms previous results, 82.2{\%} (vs 80.2{\%}) on PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset and 76.9{\%} (vs 71.8{\%}) on Cityscapes dataset.},

The new results for OMP are comparable with recent results for another approach called basis pursuit (BP).

abstract = {We propose an unsupervisedmethod for learningmulti-stage hierarchies of sparse convolutional features. While sparse coding has become an increasingly popular method for learning visual features, it is most often trained at the patch level. Applying the resulting filters convolutionally results in highly redundant codes because overlapping patches are encoded in isolation. By training convolutionally over large image windows, our method reduces the redudancy between feature vectors at neighboring locations and improves the efficiency of the overall repre- sentation. In addition to a linear decoder that reconstructs the image from sparse features, our method trains an efficient feed-forward encoder that predicts quasi- sparse features from the input. While patch-based training rarely produces any- thing but oriented edge detectors, we show that convolutional training produces highly diverse filters, including center-surround filters, corner detectors, cross de- tectors, and oriented grating detectors. We show that using these filters in multi- stage convolutional network architecture improves performance on a number of visual recognition and detection tasks.},

abstract = {We propose an end-to-end learning framework for segmenting generic objects in videos. Our method learns to combine appearance and motion information to produce pixel level segmentation masks for all prominent objects in videos. We formulate this task as a structured prediction problem and design a two-stream fully convolutional neural network which fuses together motion and appearance in a unified framework. Since large-scale video datasets with pixel level segmentations are problematic, we show how to bootstrap weakly annotated videos together with existing image recognition datasets for training. Through experiments on three challenging video segmentation benchmarks, our method substantially improves the state-of-the-art for segmenting generic (unseen) objects. Code and pre-trained models are available on the project website.},

@article{Cao2006,
abstract = {The paper is concerned with applying learning to rank to document retrieval. Ranking SVM is a typical method of learning to rank. We point out that there are two factors one must consider when applying Ranking SVM, in general a learning to rank method, to document retrieval. First, correctly ranking documents on the top of the result list is crucial for an Information Retrieval system. One must conduct training in a way that such ranked results are accurate. Second, the number of relevant documents can vary from query to query. One must avoid training a model biased toward queries with a large number of relevant documents. Previously, when existing methods that include Ranking SVM were applied to document retrieval, none of the two factors was taken into consideration. We show it is possible to make modifications in conventional Ranking SVM, so it can be better used for document retrieval. Specifically, we modify the Hinge Loss function in Ranking SVM to deal with the problems described above. We employ two methods to conduct optimization on the loss function: gradient descent and quadratic programming. Experimental results show that our method, referred to as Ranking SVM for IR, can outperform the conventional Ranking SVM and other existing methods for document retrieval on two datasets.},

abstract = {Detecting and reading text from natural images is a hard computer vision task that is central to a variety of emerging applications. Related problems like document character recognition have been widely studied by computer vision and machine learning researchers and are virtually solved for practical applications like reading handwritten digits. Reliably recognizing characters in more complex scenes like photographs, however, is far more difficult: the best existing methods lag well behind human performance on the same tasks. In this paper we attack the prob- lem of recognizing digits in a real application using unsupervised feature learning methods: reading house numbers from street level photos. To this end, we intro- duce a new benchmark dataset for research use containing over 600,000 labeled digits cropped from Street View images. We then demonstrate the difficulty of recognizing these digits when the problem is approached with hand-designed fea- tures. Finally, we employ variants of two recently proposed unsupervised feature learning methods and find that they are convincingly superior on our benchmarks. 1},

abstract = {Recent advances in deep learning, especially deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have led to significant improvement over previous semantic segmentation systems. Here we show how to improve pixel-wise semantic segmentation by manipulating convolution-related operations that are better for practical use. First, we implement dense upsampling convolution (DUC) to generate pixel-level prediction, which is able to capture and decode more detailed information that is generally missing in bilinear upsampling. Second, we propose a hybrid dilated convolution (HDC) framework in the encoding phase. This framework 1) effectively enlarges the receptive fields of the network to aggregate global information; 2) alleviates what we call the "gridding issue" caused by the standard dilated convolution operation. We evaluate our approaches thoroughly on the Cityscapes dataset, and achieve a new state-of-art result of 80.1{\%} mIOU in the test set. We also are state-of-the-art overall on the KITTI road estimation benchmark and the PASCAL VOC2012 segmentation task. Pretrained models are available at https://goo.gl/DQMeun},

abstract = {The need for appropriate ways to measure the distance or similarity between data is ubiquitous in machine learning, pattern recognition and data mining, but handcrafting such good metrics for specific problems is generally difficult. This has led to the emergence of metric learning, which aims at automatically learning a metric from data and has attracted a lot of interest in machine learning and related fields for the past ten years. This survey paper proposes a systematic review of the metric learning literature, highlighting the pros and cons of each approach. We pay particular attention to Mahalanobis distance metric learning, a well-studied and successful framework, but additionally present a wide range of methods that have recently emerged as powerful alternatives, including nonlinear metric learning, similarity learning and local metric learning. Recent trends and extensions, such as semi-supervised metric learning, metric learning for histogram data and the derivation of generalization guarantees, are also covered. Finally, this survey addresses metric learning for structured data, in particular edit distance learning, and attempts to give an overview of the remaining challenges in metric learning for the years to come.},

abstract = {Fractures of the talus, calcaneus and tarsal are associated with a significant reduction in earning capacity. Their diagnosis and therapy, therefore, are of particular importance. In order to avoid overlooking these injuries, well-lit and standardised X-rays in three defined planes are required; in the case of even slight doubt, thin-slice computer tomography in two planes is necessary. Talus fractures are anatomically set, central talus fractures are treated using stable screw fixation, while peripheral fractures are treated using mini-screw fixation. Calcaneus fractures are treated using anatomical and stable surgical internal fixation, while second and third degree open fractures can often only be covered using free flaps. Tarsal fractures of the Chopart and Lisfranc joints remain today the most frequently overlooked or insufficiently treated foot fractures. They usually require an open procedure with anatomic repositioning and fixation; in the case of multiple fractures, anatomic and angle-stable titanium implants are required. {\textcopyright} Springer Medizin Verlag 2009.},

abstract = {The objective of this case study was to obtain some first-hand information about the functional consequences of a cosmetic tongue split operation for speech and tongue motility. One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

@article{Bazzani2016,
abstract = {This paper introduces self-taught object localization, a novel approach that leverages deep convolutional networks trained for whole-image recognition to localize objects in images without additional human supervision, i.e., without using any ground-truth bounding boxes for training. The key idea is to analyze the change in the recognition scores when artificially masking out different regions of the image. The masking out of a region that includes the object typically causes a significant drop in recognition score. This idea is embedded into an agglomerative clustering technique that generates self-taught localization hypotheses. Our object localization scheme outperforms existing proposal methods in both precision and recall for small number of subwindow proposals (e.g., on ILSVRC-2012 it produces a relative gain of 23.4{\%} over the state-of-the-art for top-1 hypothesis). Furthermore, our experiments show that the annotations automatically-generated by our method can be used to train object detectors yielding recognition results remarkably close to those obtained by training on manually-annotated bounding boxes.},

The k-NNG algorithm has many applications in areas such as machine learning, bio-informatics, and clustering analysis. While there are very efficient algorithms for data of low dimensions, for high dimensional data the brute force search is the best algorithm. There are two main parts to the algorithm: the first part is finding the distances between the input vectors, which may be formulated as a matrix multiplication problem; the second is the selection of the k-NNs for each of the query vectors. For the second part, we describe a novel graphics processing unit (GPU)-based multi-select algorithm based on quick sort. Our optimization makes clever use of warp voting functions available on the latest GPUs along with user-controlled cache. Benchmarks show significant improvement over state-of-the-art implementations of the k-NN search on GPUs.},

abstract = {There is large consent that successful training of deep networks requires many thousand annotated training samples. In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU. The full implementation (based on Caffe) and the trained networks are available at http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net .},

@article{Csurka2011,
abstract = {We consider the problem of semantic segmentation, i.e. assigning each pixel in an image to a set of pre-defined semantic object categories. State-of-the-art semantic segmentation algorithms typically consist of three components: a local appearance model, a local consistency model and a global consistency model. These three components are generally integrated into a unified probabilistic framework. While it enables at training time a joint estimation of the model parameters and while it ensures at test time a globally consistent labeling of the pixels, it also comes at a high computational cost. We propose a simple approach to semantic segmentation where the three components are decoupled (this journal submission is an extended version of the following conference paper: G. Csurka and F. Perronnin, A simple high performance approach to semantic segmentation, BMVC, 2008). For the local appearance model, we make use of the Fisher kernel. While this framework was shown to lead to high accuracy for image classification, to our best knowledge this is its first application to the segmentation problem. The semantic segmentation process is then guided by a low-level segmentation which enforces local consistency. Finally, to enforce image-level consistency we use global image classifiers: if an image as a whole is unlikely to contain an object class, then the corresponding class is not considered in the segmentation pipeline. The decoupling of the components makes our system very efficient both at training and test time. An efficient training enables to estimate the model parameters on large quantities of data. Especially, we explain how our system can leverage weakly labeled data, i.e. images for which we do not have pixel-level labels but either object bounding boxes or even only image-level labels. We believe that an important contribution of this paper is to show that even a simple decoupled system can provide state-of-the-art performance on the PASCAL VOC 2007, PASCAL VOC 2008 and MSRC 21 datasets.},

abstract = {Interactive object selection is a very important research problem and has many applications. Previous algorithms require substantial user interactions to estimate the fore-ground and background distributions. In this paper, we present a novel deep-learning-based algorithm which has a much better understanding of objectness and thus can re-duce user interactions to just a few clicks. Our algorithm transforms user-provided positive and negative clicks into two Euclidean distance maps which are then concatenated with the RGB channels of images to compose (image, user interactions) pairs. We generate many of such pairs by com-bining several random sampling strategies to model users' click patterns and use them to finetune deep Fully Convo-lutional Networks (FCNs). Finally the output probability maps of our FCN-8s model is integrated with graph cut op-timization to refine the boundary segments. Our model is trained on the PASCAL segmentation dataset and evaluated on other datasets with different object classes. Experimen-tal results on both seen and unseen objects clearly demon-strate that our algorithm has a good generalization ability and is superior to all existing interactive object selection approaches.},

abstract = {In recent years there has been a growing interest in the study of sparse representation of signals. Using an overcomplete dictionary that contains prototype signal-atoms, signals are described by sparse linear combinations of these atoms. Applications that use sparse representation are many and include compression, regularization in inverse problems, feature extraction, and more. Recent activity in this field has concentrated mainly on the study of pursuit algorithms that decompose signals with respect to a given dictionary. Designing dictionaries to better fit the above model can be done by either selecting one from a prespecified set of linear transforms or adapting the dictionary to a set of training signals. Both of these techniques have been considered, but this topic is largely still open. In this paper we propose a novel algorithm for adapting dictionaries in order to achieve sparse signal representations. Given a set of training signals, we seek the dictionary that leads to the best representation for each member in this set, under strict sparsity constraints. We present a new method-the K-SVD algorithm-generalizing the K-means clustering process. K-SVD is an iterative method that alternates between sparse coding of the examples based on the current dictionary and a process of updating the dictionary atoms to better fit the data. The update of the dictionary columns is combined with an update of the sparse representations, thereby accelerating convergence. The K-SVD algorithm is flexible and can work with any pursuit method (e.g., basis pursuit, FOCUSS, or matching pursuit). We analyze this algorithm and demonstrate its results both on synthetic tests and in applications on real image data},

abstract = {Many deep neural networks trained on natural images exhibit a curious phenomenon in common: on the first layer they learn features similar to Gabor filters and color blobs. Such first-layer features appear not to be specific to a particular dataset or task, but general in that they are applicable to many datasets and tasks. Features must eventually transition from general to specific by the last layer of the network, but this transition has not been studied extensively. In this paper we experimentally quantify the generality versus specificity of neurons in each layer of a deep convolutional neural network and report a few surprising results. Transferability is negatively affected by two distinct issues: (1) the specialization of higher layer neurons to their original task at the expense of performance on the target task, which was expected, and (2) optimization difficulties related to splitting networks between co-adapted neurons, which was not expected. In an example network trained on ImageNet, we demonstrate that either of these two issues may dominate, depending on whether features are transferred from the bottom, middle, or top of the network. We also document that the transferability of features decreases as the distance between the base task and target task increases, but that transferring features even from distant tasks can be better than using random features. A final surprising result is that initializing a network with transferred features from almost any number of layers can produce a boost to generalization that lingers even after fine-tuning to the target dataset.},

Given a small num- ber of user-labelled pixels, the rest of the image is segmented au- tomatically by a Cellular Automaton. The process is iterative, as the automaton labels the image, user can observe the segmentation evolution and guide the algorithm with human input where the seg- mentation is difficult to compute. In the areas, where the segmen- tation is reliably computed automatically no additional user effort is required. Results of segmenting generic photos and medical im- ages are presented. Our experiments show that modest user effort is required for segmentation of moderately hard images.},

abstract = {Many classes of images exhibit rotational symmetry. Convolutional neural networks are sometimes trained using data augmentation to exploit this, but they are still required to learn the rotation equivariance properties from the data. Encoding these properties into the network architecture, as we are already used to doing for translation equivariance by using convolutional layers, could result in a more efficient use of the parameter budget by relieving the model from learning them. We introduce four operations which can be inserted into neural network models as layers, and which can be combined to make these models partially equivariant to rotations. They also enable parameter sharing across different orientations. We evaluate the effect of these architectural modifications on three datasets which exhibit rotational symmetry and demonstrate improved performance with smaller models.},

@article{Valizadegan2009,
abstract = {Learning to rank is a relatively new field of study, aiming to learn a ranking function from a set of training data with relevancy labels. The ranking algorithms are often evaluated using information retrieval measures, such as Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) [1] and Mean Average Precision (MAP) [2]. Until recently, most learning to rank algorithms were not using a loss function related to the above mentioned evaluation measures. The main difficulty in direct optimization of these measures is that they depend on the ranks of documents, not the numerical values output by the ranking function. We propose a probabilistic framework that addresses this challenge by optimizing the expectation of NDCG over all the possible permutations of documents. A relaxation strategy is used to approximate the average of NDCG over the space of permutation, and a bound optimization approach is proposed to make the computation efficient. Extensive experiments show that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art ranking algorithms on several benchmark data sets. 1},

abstract = {Many object detection systems are constrained by the time required to convolve a target image with a bank of filters that code for different aspects of an object's appearance, such as the presence of component parts. We exploit locality-sensitive hashing to replace the dot-product kernel operator in the convolution with a fixed number of hash-table probes that effectively sample all of the filter responses in time independent of the size of the filter bank. To show the effectiveness of the technique, we apply it to evaluate 100,000 deformable-part models requiring over a million (part) filters on multiple scales of a target image in less than 20 seconds using a single multi-core processor with 20GB of RAM. This represents a speed-up of approximately 20,000 times - four orders of magnitude - when compared with performing the convolutions explicitly on the same hardware. While mean average precision over the full set of 100,000 object classes is around 0.16 due in large part to the challenges in gathering training data and collecting ground truth for so many classes, we achieve a mAP of at least 0.20 on a third of the classes and 0.30 or better on about 20{\%} of the classes.

abstract = {It has been shown that the activations invoked by an image within the top layers of a large convolutional neural network provide a high-level descriptor of the visual content of the image. In this paper, we investigate the use of such descriptors (neural codes) within the image retrieval application. In the experiments with several standard retrieval benchmarks, we establish that neural codes perform competitively even when the convolutional neural network has been trained for an unrelated classification task (e.g. Image-Net). We also evaluate the improvement in the retrieval performance of neural codes, when the network is retrained on a dataset of images that are similar to images encountered at test time. We further evaluate the performance of the compressed neural codes and show that a simple PCA compression provides very good short codes that give state-of-the-art accuracy on a number of datasets. In general, neural codes turn out to be much more resilient to such compression in comparison other state-of-the-art descriptors. Finally, we show that discriminative dimensionality reduction trained on a dataset of pairs of matched photographs improves the performance of PCA-compressed neural codes even further. Overall, our quantitative experiments demonstrate the promise of neural codes as visual descriptors for image retrieval.},

We also introduce a novel deep learning approach to localization by learning to predict object boundaries. Bounding boxes are then accumulated rather than suppressed in order to increase detection confidence. We show that different tasks can be learned simultaneously using a single shared network. This integrated framework is the winner of the localization task of the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2013 (ILSVRC2013) and obtained very competitive results for the detection and classifications tasks.

abstract = {Most modern face recognition systems rely on a feature representation given by a hand-crafted image descriptor, such as Local Binary Patterns (LBP), and achieve improved performance by combining several such representations. In this paper, we propose deep learning as a natural source for obtaining additional, complementary representations. To learn features in high-resolution images, we make use of convolutional deep belief networks. Moreover, to take advantage of global structure in an object class, we develop local convolutional restricted Boltzmann machines, a novel convolutional learning model that exploits the global structure by not assuming stationarity of features across the image, while maintaining scalability and robustness to small misalignments. We also present a novel application of deep learning to descriptors other than pixel intensity values, such as LBP. In addition, we compare performance of networks trained using unsupervised learning against networks with random filters, and empirically show that learning weights not only is necessary for obtaining good multilayer representations, but also provides robustness to the choice of the network architecture parameters. Finally, we show that a recognition system using only representations obtained from deep learning can achieve comparable accuracy with a system using a combination of hand-crafted image descriptors. Moreover, by combining these representations, we achieve state-of-the-art results on a real-world face verification database.},

We propose a method that uses a multiscale convolutional network trained from raw pixels to extract dense feature vectors that encode regions of multiple sizes centered on each pixel. The method alleviates the need for engineered features, and produces a powerful representation that captures texture, shape and contextual information.We report results using multiple post-processing methods to produce the final labeling. Among those, we propose a technique to automatically retrieve, from a pool of segmentation components, an optimal set of components that best explain the scene; these components are arbitrary, e.g. they can be taken from a segmentation tree, or from any family of over-segmentations. The system yields record accuracies on the Sift Flow Dataset (33 classes) and the Barcelona Dataset (170 classes) and near-record accuracy on Stanford Background Dataset (8 classes), while being an order of magnitude faster than competing approaches, producing a 320×240 image labeling in less than a second, including feature extraction.},

While tremendous progress has been made over the last years in visual location recognition within a single city, localization in natural environments is much more difficult, since vegetation, illumination, seasonal changes make appearance-only approaches impractical. In this work, we target mountainous terrain and use digital elevation models to extract representations for fast visual database lookup. We propose an automated approach for very large scale visual localization that can efficiently exploit visual information (contours) and geometric constraints (consistent orientation) at the same time. We validate the system on the scale of a whole country (Switzerland, 40 000km2) using a new dataset of more than 200 landscape query pictures with ground truth.},

abstract = {Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have an important effect on system defense and security. Recently, most IDS methods have used transformed features, selected features, or original features. Both feature transformation and feature selection have their advantages. Neighborhood component analysis feature transformation and genetic feature selection (NCAGAFS) is proposed in this research. NCAGAFS is based on soft computing and data mining and uses the advantages of both transformation and selection. This method transforms features via neighborhood component analysis and chooses the best features with a classifier based on a genetic feature selection method. This novel approach is verified using the KDD Cup99 dataset, demonstrating higher performances than other well-known methods under various classifiers have demonstrated.},

abstract = {We address the problem of recovering shape, albedo, and illumination from a single grayscale image of an object, using shading as our primary cue. Because this problem is fundamentally underconstrained, we construct statistical models of albedo and shape, and define an optimization problem that searches for the most likely explanation of a single image. We present two priors on albedo which encourage local smoothness and global sparsity, and three priors on shape which encourage flatness, outward-facing orientation at the occluding contour, and local smoothness. We present an optimization technique for using these priors to recover shape, albedo, and a spherical harmonic model of illumination. Our model, which we call SAIFS (shape, albedo, and illumination from shading) produces reasonable results on arbitrary grayscale images taken in the real world, and outperforms all previous grayscale {\&}{\#}x201C;intrinsic image{\&}{\#}x201D; - style algorithms on the MIT Intrinsic Images dataset.},

These results have largely come from computational break throughs of two forms: model parallelism, e.g. GPU accelerated training, which has seen quick adoption in computer vision circles, and data parallelism, e.g. A-SGD, whose large scale has been used mostly in industry. We report early experiments with a system that makes use of both model parallelism and data parallelism, we call GPU A-SGD. We show using GPU A-SGD it is possible to speed up training of large convolutional neural networks useful for computer vision. We believe GPU A-SGD will make it possible to train larger networks on larger training sets in a reasonable amount of time.},

@article{Hoi2008,
abstract = {Ranking plays a central role in many Web search and information retrieval applications. Ensemble ranking, sometimes called meta-search, aims to improve the retrieval performance by combining the outputs from multiple ranking algorithms. Many ensemble ranking approaches employ supervised learning techniques to learn appropriate weights for combining multiple rankers. The main shortcoming with these approaches is that the learned weights for ranking algorithms are query independent. This is suboptimal since a ranking algorithm could perform well for certain queries but poorly for others. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised ensemble ranking (SSER) algorithm that learns query-dependent weights when combining multiple rankers in document retrieval. The proposed SSER algorithm is formulated as an SVM-like quadratic program (QP), and therefore can be solved efficiently by taking advantage of optimization techniques that were widely used in existing SVM solvers. We evaluated the proposed technique on a standard document retrieval testbed and observed encouraging results by comparing to a number of state-of-the-art techniques.},

abstract = {We study a k-dimensional generalization of the birthday problem: given k lists of n-bit values, find some way to choose one el- ement from each list so that the resulting k values xor to zero. For k = 2, this is just the extremely well-known birthday problem, which has a square-root time algorithm with many applications in cryptogra- phy. In this paper, we show new algorithms for the case k{\textgreater} 2: we show a cube-root time algorithm for the case of k = 4 lists, and we give an algorithm with subexponential running time when k is unrestricted. We also give several applications to cryptanalysis, describing new subex- ponential algorithms for constructing one-more forgeries for certain blind signature schemes, for breaking certain incremental hash functions, and for finding low-weight parity check equations for fast correlation attacks on stream ciphers. In these applications, our algorithm runs in O(2{\^{}}2√n) time for an n-bit modulus, demonstrating that moduli may need to be at least 1600 bits long for security against these new attacks. As an example, we describe the first-known attack with subexponential com- plexity on Schnorr and Okamoto-Schnorr blind signatures over elliptic curve groups.},

abstract = {Objective. To determine whether breastfeeding reduced the risk of childhood obesity in the infants of a multi-ethnic cohort of women with pregestational diabetes. Methods. In this retrospective cohort study, women with pregestational diabetes were mailed a questionnaire about breastfeeding and current height and weight of mothers and infants. Predictors of obesity (weight for age {\textgreater}85 percentile) were assessed among offspring of index pregnancies, using univariate and multivariable logistic regression. Results. Of 125 women, 81 (65{\%}) had type 1 diabetes and 44 (35{\%}) had type 2 diabetes. The mean age of offspring was 4.5 years. On univariate analysis, significant predictors of obesity in offspring were type 2 diabetes (odds ratio, OR 2.4, 95{\%} confidence interval, CI 0.99-5.72); maternal body mass index (BMI) {\textgreater} 25 (OR 4.4, 95{\%} CI 1.4-19.4); and any breastfeeding (OR 0.22, 95{\%} CI 0.07-0.72). After multivariable adjustment, breastfeeding (OR 0.20, 95{\%} CI 0.06-0.69) and having an overweight/obese mother (OR 3.49, 95{\%} CI 1.03-16.2) remained independently associated with childhood obesity. Conclusion. Breastfeeding significantly decreased the likelihood of obesity in offspring of mothers with pregestational diabetes, independent of maternal BMI and diabetes type. Women with diabetes should be encouraged to breastfeed, given the increased risk of obesity in their children.},

abstract = {Most previous bounding-box-based segmentation methods assume the bounding box tightly covers the object of interest. However it is common that a rectangle input could be too large or too small. In this paper, we propose a novel segmentation approach that uses a rectangle as a soft constraint by transforming it into an Euclidean distance map. A convolutional encoder-decoder network is trained end-to-end by concatenating images with these distance maps as inputs and predicting the object masks as outputs. Our approach gets accurate segmentation results given sloppy rectangles while being general for both interactive segmentation and instance segmentation. We show our network extends to curve-based input without retraining. We further apply our network to instance-level semantic segmentation and resolve any overlap using a conditional random field. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.},

abstract = {Building intelligent systems that are capable of extracting high-level representations from high-dimensional sensory data lies at the core of solving many AI related tasks, including object recognition, speech perception, and language understanding. Theoretical and biological arguments strongly suggest that building such systems requires models with deep architectures that involve many layers of nonlinear processing.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe aim of the thesis is to demonstrate that deep generative models that contain many layers of latent variables and millions of parameters can be learned efficiently, and that the learned high-level feature representations can be successfully applied in a wide spectrum of application domains, including visual object recognition, information retrieval, and classification and regression tasks. In addition, similar methods can be used for nonlinear dimensionality reduction.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe first part of the thesis focuses on analysis and applications of probabilistic generative models called Deep Belief Networks. We show that these deep hierarchical models can learn useful feature representations from a large supply of unlabeled sensory inputs. The learned high-level representations capture a lot of structure in the input data, which is useful for subsequent problem-specific tasks, such as classification, regression or information retrieval, even though these tasks are unknown when the generative model is being trained.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nIn the second part of the thesis, we introduce a new learning algorithm for a different type of hier- archical probabilistic model, which we call a Deep Boltzmann Machine. Like Deep Belief Networks, Deep Boltzmann Machines have the potential of learning internal representations that become increas- ingly complex at higher layers, which is a promising way of solving object and speech recognition problems. Unlike Deep Belief Networks and many existing models with deep architectures, the approx- imate inference procedure, in addition to a fast bottom-up pass, can incorporate top-down feedback. This allows Deep Boltzmann Machines to better propagate uncertainty about ambiguous inputs.},

abstract = {Archaeologists often spend significant time looking at traditional printed catalogs to identify and classify historical images. Our collaborative efforts between archaeologists and multimedia researchers seek to develop a tool to retrieve two specific types of ancient Maya visual information: hieroglyphs and iconographic elements. Towards that goal we present two contributions in this paper. The first one is the introduction and analysis of a new dataset of 3400+ Maya hieroglyphs, whose compilation involved manual search, annotation and segmentation by experts. This dataset presents several challenges for visual description and automatic retrieval as it is rich in complex visual details. The second and main contribution is the in-depth analysis of the Histogram Of Orientation Shape Context (HOOSC), and more precisely, the development of 4 improvements that were designed to handle the visual complexity of Maya hieroglyphs: open contours, mixture of thick and thin lines, hatches, large instance variability, and a variety of internal details. Experiments demonstrate that the adequate combination of our improvements to retrieve Maya hieroglyphs, provides results with roughly 20{\%} more precision compared to the original HOOSC descriptor. Complementary results with the MPEG-7 shape dataset validate the proposed improvements, showing that the design of appropriate descriptors depends on the nature of the shapes one deals with.},

abstract = {Recently, there have been several promising methods to generate realistic imagery from deep convolutional networks. These methods sidestep the traditional computer graphics rendering pipeline and instead generate imagery at the pixel level by learning from large collections of photos (e.g. faces or bedrooms). However, these methods are of limited utility because it is difficult for a user to control what the network produces. In this paper, we propose a deep adversarial image synthesis architecture that is conditioned on sketched boundaries and sparse color strokes to generate realistic cars, bedrooms, or faces. We demonstrate a sketch based image synthesis system which allows users to 'scribble' over the sketch to indicate preferred color for objects. Our network can then generate convincing images that satisfy both the color and the sketch constraints of user. The network is feed-forward which allows users to see the effect of their edits in real time. We compare to recent work on sketch to image synthesis and show that our approach can generate more realistic, more diverse, and more controllable outputs. The architecture is also effective at user-guided colorization of grayscale images.},

abstract = {Training object class detectors typically requires a large set of images with objects annotated by bounding boxes. However, manually drawing bounding boxes is very time consuming. In this paper we greatly reduce annotation time by proposing center-click annotations: we ask annotators to click on the center of an imaginary bounding box which tightly encloses the object instance. We then incorporate these clicks into existing Multiple Instance Learning techniques for weakly supervised object localization, to jointly localize object bounding boxes over all training images. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2007 and MS COCO show that: (1) our scheme delivers high-quality detectors, performing substantially better than those produced by weakly supervised techniques, with a modest extra annotation effort; (2) these detectors in fact perform in a range close to those trained from manually drawn bounding boxes; (3) as the center-click task is very fast, our scheme reduces total annotation time by 9x to 18x.},

Many of the papers describing new techniques and descriptors for content-based image retrieval describe their newly proposed methods as most appropriate without giving an in-depth comparison with all methods that were proposed earlier. In this paper, we first give an overview of a large variety of features for content-based image retrieval and compare them quantitatively on four different tasks: stock photo retrieval, personal photo collection retrieval, building retrieval, and medical image retrieval. For the experiments, five different, publicly available image databases are used and the retrieval performance of the features is analyzed in detail. This allows for a direct comparison of all features considered in this work and furthermore will allow a comparison of newly proposed features to these in the future. Additionally, the correlation of the features is analyzed, which opens the way for a simple and intuitive method to find an initial set of suitable features for a new task. The article concludes with recommendations which features perform well for what type of data. Interestingly, the often used, but very simple, color histogram performs well in the comparison and thus can be recommended as a simple baseline for many applications.},

@article{Hudak1999,
abstract = {Functional reactive programming, or FRP, is a style of programming based on two key ideas: continuous time-varying behaviors, and event-based reactivity. FRP is the essence of Fran [1,2], a domain-specific language for functional reactive graphics and animation, and has recently been used in the design of Frob [3,4], a domain-specific language for functional vision and robotics. In general, FRP can be viewed as an interesting language for describing hybrid systems, which are systems comprised of both analog (continuous) and digital (discrete) subsystems. Continuous behaviors can be thought of simply as functions from time to some value: Behavior a = Time -{\textgreater} a. For example: an image behavior may represent an animation; a Cartesian-point behavior may be a mouse; a velocity-vector behavior may be the control vector for a robot; and a tuple-of-distances behavior may be the input from a robot's sonar array. Both continuous behaviors and event-based reactivity have interesting pro erties worthy of independent study, but their integration is particularly interesting. At the core of the issue is that events are intended to cause discrete shifts in declarative behavior; i.e. not just shifts in the state of reactivity. Being declarative, the natural desire is for everything to be first-class and higher-order. But this causes interesting clashes in frames of reference, especially when time and space transformations are applied. In this talk the fundamental ideas behind FRP are presented, along with a discussion of various issues in its formal semantics. This is joint work with Conal Elliot at Microsoft Research, and John Peterson at Yale.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a new architecture for human pose estimation using a multi- layer convolutional network architecture and a modified learning technique that learns low-level features and higher-level weak spatial models. Unconstrained human pose estimation is one of the hardest problems in computer vision, and our new architecture and learning schema shows significant improvement over the current state-of-the-art results. The main contribution of this paper is showing, for the first time, that a specific variation of deep learning is able to outperform all existing traditional architectures on this task. The paper also discusses several lessons learned while researching alternatives, most notably, that it is possible to learn strong low-level feature detectors on features that might even just cover a few pixels in the image. Higher-level spatial models improve somewhat the overall result, but to a much lesser extent then expected. Many researchers previously argued that the kinematic structure and top-down information is crucial for this domain, but with our purely bottom up, and weak spatial model, we could improve other more complicated architectures that currently produce the best results. This mirrors what many other researchers, like those in the speech recognition, object recognition, and other domains have experienced.},

abstract = {In this work, we present a method to uncover shape from webcams in the wild. We present a variant of photometric stereo which uses the sun as a distant light source, so that lighting direction can be computed from known GPS and timestamps. We propose an iterative, non-linear optimization process that optimizes the error in reproducing all images from an extended time-lapse with an image formation model that accounts for ambient lighting, shadows, changing light color, dense surface normal maps, radiometric calibration, and exposure. Unlike many approaches to uncalibrated outdoor image analysis, this procedure is automatic, and we report quantitative results by comparing extracted surface normals to Google Earth 3D models. We evaluate this procedure on data from a varied set of scenes and emphasize the advantages of including imagery from many months.},

In this paper, we aim to learn representations for an image, which are robust to wide changes in such environmental conditions, using training pairs of matching and non-matching local image patches that are collected under various environmental conditions. We present a regularized discriminant analysis that emphasizes two challenging categories among the given training pairs: (1) matching, but far apart pairs and (2) non-matching, but close pairs in the original feature space (e.g., SIFT feature space). Compared to existing work on metric learning and discriminant analysis, our method can better distinguish relevant images from irrelevant, but look-alike images.},

The features are computed either using the phase-only spectrum or bispectrum of the images and are invariant to centrally symmetric blur, such as linear motion or defocus blur as well as linear illumination changes. The features based on the bispectrum are also invariant to translation, and according to our knowledge they are the only combined blur-translation invariants in the frequency domain. We have compared our features to the blur invariants based on image moments in simulated and real experiments. The results show that our features can recognize blurred images better and, in a practical situation, they are faster to compute using FFT.},

abstract = {Deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have shown their promise as a universal representation for recognition. However, global CNN activations at present lack geometric invariance, which limits their robustness for tasks such as classification and matching of highly variable scenes. To improve the invariance of CNN activations without degrading their discriminative power, this paper presents a simple but effective scheme called multi-scale orderless pooling (or MOP-CNN for short). This approach works by extracting CNN activations for local patches at multiple scales, followed by orderless VLAD pooling of these activations at each scale level and concatenating the result. This feature representation decisively outperforms global CNN activations and achieves state-of-the-art performance for scene classification on such challenging benchmarks as SUN397, MIT Indoor Scenes, and ILSVRC2012, as well as for instance-level retrieval on the Holidays dataset.},

abstract = {While models of fine-grained recognition have made great progress in recent years, little work has focused on a key ingredient of making recognition work: data. We use publicly available, noisy data sources to train generic models which vastly improve upon state-of-the-art on fine-grained benchmarks. First, we present an active learning system using non-expert human raters, and improve upon state-of-the-art performance without any text or other metadata associated with the images. Second, we show that training on publicly-available noisy web image search results achieves even higher accuracies, without using any expert-annotated training data, while scaling to over ten thousand fine-grained categories. We analyze the behavior of our models and data and make a strong case for the importance of data over special-purpose modeling: using only an off-the-shelf CNN, we obtain top-1 accuracies of 92.8$\backslash${\%} on CUB-200-2011 Birds, 85.4$\backslash${\%} on Birdsnap, 95.9$\backslash${\%} on FGVC-Aircraft, and 82.6$\backslash${\%} on Stanford Dogs.},

abstract = {We propose bilinear models, a recognition architecture that consists of two feature extractors whose outputs are multiplied using outer product at each location of the image and pooled to obtain an image descriptor. This architecture can model local pairwise feature interactions in a translationally invariant manner which is particularly useful for fine-grained categorization. It also generalizes various orderless texture descriptors such as the Fisher vector, VLAD and O2P. We present experiments with bilinear models where the feature extractors are based on convolutional neural networks. The bilinear form simplifies gradient computation and allows end-to-end training of both networks using image labels only. Using networks initialized from the ImageNet dataset followed by domain specific fine-tuning we obtain 84.1{\%} accuracy of the CUB-200-2011 dataset requiring only category labels at training time. We present experiments and visualizations that analyze the effects of fine-tuning and the choice two networks on the speed and accuracy of the models. Results show that the architecture compares favorably to the existing state of the art on a number of fine-grained datasets while being substantially simpler and easier to train. Moreover, our most accurate model is fairly efficient running at 8 frames/sec on a NVIDIA Tesla K40 GPU. The source code for the complete system will be made available at http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/bcnn.},

To encode such a function, we opt for a CNN-based model that is trained to account for a wide variety of changes in image appearance. To that end, we explore and study multiple neural network architectures, which are specifically adapted to this task. We show that such an approach can significantly outperform the state-of- the-art on several problems and benchmark datasets.},

@article{Bai2012,
abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new shape/object retrieval algorithm, namely, co-transduction. The performance of a retrieval system is critically decided by the accuracy of adopted similarity measures (distances or metrics). In shape/object retrieval, ideally, intraclass objects should have smaller distances than interclass objects. However, it is a difficult task to design an ideal metric to account for the large intraclass variation. Different types of measures may focus on different aspects of the objects: for example, measures computed based on contours and skeletons are often complementary to each other. Our goal is to develop an algorithm to fuse different similarity measures for robust shape retrieval through a semisupervised learning framework. We name our method co-transduction, which is inspired by the co-training algorithm. Given two similarity measures and a query shape, the algorithm iteratively retrieves the most similar shapes using one measure and assigns them to a pool for the other measure to do a re-ranking, and vice versa. Using co-transduction, we achieved an improved result of 97.72{\%} (bull's-eye measure) on the MPEG-7 data set over the state-of-the-art performance. We also present an algorithm called tri-transduction to fuse multiple-input similarities, and it achieved 99.06{\%} on the MPEG-7 data set. Our algorithm is general, and it can be directly applied on input similarity measures/metrics; it is not limited to object shape retrieval and can be applied to other tasks for ranking/retrieval.},

BVWs rely on stable interest points so that the local descriptors can be clustered into representative, discriminative prototypes (the visual words). We show that using the centers of mass of superpixels as interest points yields higher retrieval accuracy when compared to using Difference of Gaussians (DoG) or a dense grid of interest points. Evaluation is performed on two data sets. The ImageCLEF 2009 data set of 14.400 radiographs is used in a categorization setting and the results compare favorable to more specialized methods. The second set contains 13 thorax CTs and is used in a hybrid 2D/3D localization task, localizing the axial position of the lung through the retrieval of representative 2D slices.},

Every single step in this hierarchy seems to be subject to learning. How does the visual cortex learn such hierar- chical representations by just looking at the world? How could computers learn such representations from data? Computer vision models that areweakly inspired by the visual cortex will be described. A number of unsupervised learning algo- rithms to train these models will be presented, which are based on the sparse auto-encoder concept. The effectiveness of these algorithms for learning invari- ant feature hierarchies will be demonstrated with a number of practical tasks such as scene parsing, pedestrian detection, and object classification. 1},

abstract = {What are the natural loss functions or fitting criteria for binary class probability estimation? This question has a simple answer: so-called ``proper scoring rules'', that is, functions that score probability estimates in view of data in a Fisher-consistent manner. Proper scoring rules comprise most loss functions currently in use: log-loss, squared error loss, boosting loss, and as limiting cases cost-weighted misclassification losses. Proper scoring rules have a rich structure: • Every proper scoring rules is a mixture (limit of sums) of cost-weighted misclassification losses. The mixture is specified by a weight function (or measure) that describes which misclassification cost weights are most emphasized by the proper scoring rule. • Proper scoring rules permit Fisher scoring and Iteratively Reweighted LS algorithms for model fitting. The weights are derived from a link function and the above weight function. • Proper scoring rules are in a 1-1 correspondence with information measures for tree-based classification. • Proper scoring rules are also in a 1-1 correspondence with Bregman distances that can be used to derive general approximation bounds for cost-weighted misclassification errors, as well as generalized bias-variance decompositions. We illustrate the use of proper scoring rules with novel criteria for 1) Hand and Vinciotti's (2003) localized logistic regression and 2) for interpretable classification trees. We will also discuss connections with exponential loss used in boosting.},

Classical image segmentation tools use either texture (colour) information, e.g. Magic Wand, or edge (contrast) information, e.g. Intelligent Scissors. Recently, an approach based on optimization by graph-cut has been developed which successfully combines both types of information. In this paper we extend the graph-cut approach in three respects. First, we have developed a more powerful, iterative version of the optimisation. Secondly, the power of the iterative algorithm is used to simplify substantially the user interaction needed for a given quality of result. Thirdly, a robust algorithm for "border matting" has been developed to estimate simultaneously the alpha-matte around an object boundary and the colours of foreground pixels. We show that for moderately difficult examples the proposed method outperforms competitive tools.},

abstract = {WRIST PERSPECTIVE The wrist joint is broadly defined as the anatomic area from the distal radius and ulna bones of the forearm to the carpometacar-pal junctions of the hand. It is anatomically and biomechanically complex, allowing for diverse functional capabilities. In the setting of trauma, this area is exposed, mobile, and at high risk of injury. Detailed knowledge of relevant anatomy, mechanism of injury, accurate clinical assessment, and radiograph interpretation are essential for proper emergent diagnosis and treatment. Anatomy The wrist is composed of many complex articulations, including the radiocarpal, midcarpal and distal radial ulnar joints (DRUJs), allowing for flexion, extension, abduction (radial deviation), adduction (ulnar deviation), and circumduction movements. Pro-nation and supination of the hand are primarily movements of the forearm occurring at the proximal and DRUJs. The wrist includes the distal radius, ulna, and eight carpal bones, which are arranged in two transverse rows and commonly referred to as the carpus (Fig. 51-1). Each carpal row contains four bones. The more mobile, proximal row, listed radial to ulnar, consists of the scaphoid, lunate, triquetrum, and pisiform, whereas the distal row consists of the trapezium, trapezoid, capitate, and hamate bones. The radius has three articular surfaces at the wrist: the radio-carpal joint, the DRUJ, and an interface with the triangular fibro-cartilage complex (TFCC), also known as the articular disk. Only the distal radius articulates directly with the carpus via the scaph-oid and lunate bones, forming the radiographic joint, commonly referred to as the " wrist joint. " The ulna is separated from direct articulation with the proximal carpal row by the TFCC. This artic-ular disk binds the distal ends of the radius, ulna, lunate, and triquetrum together. The DRUJ is a synovial pivot where the distal radius articulates and rotates around the relatively fixed ulna, and this joint is primarily stabilized by the TFCC. Aside from the pisiform, which is considered to be a sesamoid bone embedded within the flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU) tendon, the carpus bones are lined by synovium that creates a continuous capsule throughout the intercarpal joints and distally to the meta-carpal articulations. The only muscular insertions that occur throughout the carpus are the origin of the abductor digiti minimi from the pisiform and the point at which the FCU tendon inserts onto the hook of the hamate. As a result, nearly all carpal bone movements are passive based on muscular insertions on the distal radius, ulna, and metacarpal bases. The stabilizing ligaments of the wrist joint are divided into two major groups: the intrinsic ligaments and the extrinsic ligaments. The intrinsic ligaments interconnect the individual carpal bones, and the extrinsic ligaments link the carpal bones to the distal radius, the ulna, and the metacarpals. The intrinsics are named for the adjacent bones they connect, and the most important for maintaining carpal stability are the scapholunate and lunotriqu-etral ligaments. The extrinsics are divided into a volar and dorsal group. The volar extrinsic ligaments are divided into two V-shaped ligamentous bands called the proximal and distal arcades, which generally are thicker and stronger than the dorsal extrinsic liga-ments and are the most important in providing stability to the wrist. Between these volar arcades is an area relatively devoid of ligamentous support called the space of Poirier. This space enlarges when the wrist is dorsiflexed, and an injury to the joint capsule in this region can result in significant carpal instability (Fig. 51-2). Most structures that cross the wrist joint are contained within individual compartments formed by the deep fascia of the wrist. On the dorsal surface of the wrist, the extensor tendons are divided by the extensor retinaculum into six compartments, each having a separate synovial sheath that extends proximal and distal to the retinaculum. On the volar surface of the wrist, the flexors of the digits and the median nerve are contained within the carpal tunnel, which is formed by the flexor retinaculum superficially and its attachments to the carpal bones. Radially, the flexor reti-naculum attaches to the scaphoid tubercle and the ridge of the trapezium. On the ulnar side, it attaches to the pisiform and the hook of the hamate. The floor of the carpal tunnel is formed by both the trapezoid and capitate bones. Radial and superficial to the carpal tunnel, the flexor carpi radialis tendon crosses the wrist joint in its own compartment. The vascular supply to the wrist is provided by the radial and ulnar arteries, which join in a series of dorsal and palmar arches to supply the bones of the carpus. The intrinsic blood supply to most carpal bones enters the distal portion of the bone, leaving the proximal portion at risk for devascularization and avascular necrosis (AVN) when fractured. This is particularly true for the scaphoid, capitate, and lunate, because they each receive their blood supply from a single distal vessel (Fig. 51-3). The innervation of the wrist and hand is by the radial, median, and ulnar nerves. The radial nerve and the dorsal sensory branch of the ulnar nerve cross the dorsum of the wrist near the radial and ulnar styloids, respectively. The median nerve crosses within the carpal tunnel on the volar aspect of the wrist just radial and deep to the palmaris longus tendon. The ulnar nerve is within Guyon's canal between the pisiform and the hook of the hamate (see Fig. 51-3). In the setting of trauma, motor and sensory function of the radial, median, and ulnar nerves may be assessed},

Thirdly , it has been shown that the realm of metric learning is not limited to k - nearest neighbor (k - NN) classification , and that a metric optimized in the k - nearest neigh - bor setting is likely to be effective and applicable in other kernel - based frameworks , for example Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Gaussian Processes (GP) classifiers . We support our hypotheses by tuning the length - scale parameters of GP with metric learning method proposed in k - NN framework .

abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks define an exceptionally powerful class of models, but are still limited by the lack of ability to be spatially invariant to the input data in a computationally and parameter efficient manner. In this work we introduce a new learnable module, the Spatial Transformer, which explicitly allows the spatial manipulation of data within the network. This differentiable module can be inserted into existing convolutional architectures, giving neural networks the ability to actively spatially transform feature maps, conditional on the feature map itself, without any extra training supervision or modification to the optimisation process. We show that the use of spatial transformers results in models which learn invariance to translation, scale, rotation and more generic warping, resulting in state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, and for a number of classes of transformations.},

abstract = {The task of image auto-annotation, namely assigning a set of relevant tags to an image, is challenging due to the size and variability of tag vocabularies. Consequently, most existing algorithms focus on tag assignment and fix an often large number of hand-crafted features to describe image characteristics. In this paper we introduce a hierarchical model for learning representations of standard sized color images from the pixel level, removing the need for engineered feature representations and subsequent feature selection for annotation. We benchmark our model on the STL-10 recognition dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance. When our features are combined with TagProp (Guillaumin et al.), we compete with or outperform existing annotation approaches that use over a dozen distinct handcrafted image descriptors. Furthermore, using 256-bit codes and Hamming distance for training TagProp, we exchange only a small reduction in performance for efficient storage and fast comparisons. Self-taught learning is used in all of our experiments and deeper architectures always outperform shallow ones.},

abstract = {Convolutional networks are one of the most widely employed architectures in computer vision and machine learning. In order to leverage their ability to learn complex functions, large amounts of data are required for training. Training a large convolutional network to produce state-of-the-art results can take weeks, even when using modern GPUs. Producing labels using a trained network can also be costly when dealing with web-scale datasets. In this work, we present a simple algorithm which accelerates training and inference by a signiﬁcant factor, and can yield improvements of over an order of magnitude compared to existing state-of-the-art implementations. This is done by computing convolutions as pointwise products in the Fourier domain while reusing the same transformed feature map many times. The algorithm is implemented on a GPU architecture and addresses a number of related challenges.},

abstract = {Pose variation and subtle differences in appearance are key challenges to fine-grained classification. While deep networks have markedly improved general recognition, many approaches to fine-grained recognition rely on anchoring networks to parts for better accuracy. Identifying parts to find correspondence discounts pose variation so that features can be tuned to appearance. To this end previous methods have examined how to find parts and extract pose-normalized features. These methods have generally separated fine-grained recognition into stages which first localize parts using hand-engineered and coarsely-localized proposal features, and then separately learn deep descriptors centered on inferred part positions. We unify these steps in an end-to-end trainable network supervised by keypoint locations and class labels that localizes parts by a fully convolutional network to focus the learning of feature representations for the fine-grained classification task. Experiments on the popular CUB200 dataset show that our method is state-of-the-art and suggest a continuing role for strong supervision.},

@article{Sattler2012,
abstract = {We propose a powerful pipeline for determining the pose of a query image relative to a point cloud reconstruction of a large scene consisting of more than one million 3D points. The key component of our approach is an ecient and e ective search method to establish matches between image features and scene points needed for pose estimation. Our main contribution is a framework for actively searching for additional matches, based on both 2D-to-3D and 3D-to-2D search. A uni ed formulation of search in both directions allows us to exploit the distinct advantages of both strategies, while avoiding their weaknesses. Due to active search, the resulting pipeline is able to close the gap in registration performance observed between ecient search methods and approaches that are allowed to run for multiple seconds, without sacri cing runtime eciency. Our method achieves the best registration performance published so far on three standard benchmark datasets, with run-times comparable or superior to the fastest state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {We present a hybrid neural-network for human face recognition which compares favourably with other methods. The system combines local image sampling, a self-organizing map (SOM) neural network, and a convolutional neural network. The SOM provides a quantization of the image samples into a topological space where inputs that are nearby in the original space are also nearby in the output space, thereby providing dimensionality reduction and invariance to minor changes in the image sample, and the convolutional neural network provides partial invariance to translation, rotation, scale, and deformation. The convolutional network extracts successively larger features in a hierarchical set of layers. We present results using the Karhunen-Loeve transform in place of the SOM, and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) in place of the convolutional network for comparison. We use a database of 400 images of 40 individuals which contains quite a high degree of variability in expression, pose, and facial details. We analyze the computational complexity and discuss how new classes could be added to the trained recognizer.},

abstract = {We address the problem of recovering shape, albedo, and illumination from a single grayscale image of an object, using shading as our primary cue. Because this problem is fundamentally underconstrained, we construct statistical models of albedo and shape, and define an optimization problem that searches for the most likely explanation of a single image. We present two priors on albedo which encourage local smoothness and global sparsity, and three priors on shape which encourage flatness, outward-facing orientation at the occluding contour, and local smoothness. We present an optimization technique for using these priors to recover shape, albedo, and a spherical harmonic model of illumination. Our model, which we call SAIFS (shape, albedo, and illumination from shading) produces reasonable results on arbitrary grayscale images taken in the real world, and outperforms all previous grayscale {\&}{\#}x201C;intrinsic image{\&}{\#}x201D; - style algorithms on the MIT Intrinsic Images dataset.},

abstract = {3D model-based object recognition has been a noticeable research trend $\backslash$nin recent years. Common methods find 2D-to-3D correspondences and make $\backslash$nrecognition decisions by pose estimation, whose efficiency usually suffers from $\backslash$nnoisy correspondences caused by the increasing number of target objects. To $\backslash$novercome this scalability bottleneck, we propose an efficient 2D-to-3D $\backslash$ncorrespondence filtering approach, which combines a light-weight $\backslash$nneighborhood-based step with a finer-grained pairwise step to remove spurious $\backslash$ncorrespondences based on 2D/3D geometric cues. On a dataset of 300 3D objects, $\backslash$nour solution achieves {\~{}}10 times speed improvement over the baseline, with a $\backslash$ncomparable recognition accuracy. A parallel implementation on a quad-core CPU $\backslash$ncan run at {\~{}}3fps for 1280×720 images.},

abstract = {The so-called bag-of-features (BoF) representation for im- ages is by now well-established in the context of large scale image and video retrieval. The BoF framework typically ranks database image ac- cording to a metric on the global histograms of the query and database images, respectively. Ranking based on global histograms has the advan- tage of being scalable with respect to the number of database images, but at the cost of reduced retrieval precision when the object of interest is small. Additionally, computationally intensive post-processing (such as RANSAC) is typically required to locate the object of interest in the retrieved images. To address these shortcomings, we propose a general- ization of the global BoF framework to support scalable local matching. Specifically, we propose an efficient and accurate algorithm to accom- plish local histogram matching and object localization simultaneously. The generalization is to represent each database image as a family of histograms that depend functionally on a bounding rectangle. Integral with the image retrieval process, we identify bounding rectangles whose histograms optimize query relevance, and rank the images accordingly. Through this localization scheme, we impose a weak spatial consistency constraint with low computational overhead. We validate our approach on two public image retrieval benchmarks: the University of Kentucky data set and the Oxford Building data set. Experiments show that our approach significantly improves on BoF-based retrieval, without requir- ing computationally expensive post-processing.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Additionally, a simple binarization scheme produces compact representations that perform better than several state-of-the-art descriptors.},

The idea lies in augmenting an existing attribute-based representation with additional dimensions for which an autoencoder model is coupled with a large-margin principle. This construction allows a smooth transition between the zero-shot regime with no training example, the unsupervised regime with training examples but without class labels, and the supervised regime with training examples and with class labels. The resulting optimization problem can be solved efficiently, because several of the necessity steps have closed-form solutions. Through extensive experiments we show that the augmented representation achieves better results in terms of object categorization accuracy than the semantic representation alone.},

@article{Zhang2012a,
abstract = {With many potential practical applications, content-based image retrieval (CBIR) has attracted substantial attention during the past few years. A variety of relevance feedback (RF) schemes have been developed as a powerful tool to bridge the semantic gap between low-level visual features and high-level semantic concepts, and thus to improve the performance of CBIR systems. Among various RF approaches, support-vector-machine (SVM)-based RF is one of the most popular techniques in CBIR. Despite the success, directly using SVM as an RF scheme has two main drawbacks. First, it treats the positive and negative feedbacks equally, which is not appropriate since the two groups of training feedbacks have distinct properties. Second, most of the SVM-based RF techniques do not take into account the unlabeled samples, although they are very helpful in constructing a good classifier. To explore solutions to overcome these two drawbacks, in this paper, we propose a biased maximum margin analysis (BMMA) and a semisupervised BMMA (SemiBMMA) for integrating the distinct properties of feedbacks and utilizing the information of unlabeled samples for SVM-based RF schemes. The BMMA differentiates positive feedbacks from negative ones based on local analysis, whereas the SemiBMMA can effectively integrate information of unlabeled samples by introducing a Laplacian regularizer to the BMMA. We formally formulate this problem into a general subspace learning task and then propose an automatic approach of determining the dimensionality of the embedded subspace for RF. Extensive experiments on a large real-world image database demonstrate that the proposed scheme combined with the SVM RF can significantly improve the performance of CBIR systems.},

@article{Lv2012,
abstract = {Local feature points have been widely investigated in solving problems in computer vision, such as robust matching and object detection. However, its investigation in the area of image hashing is still limited. In this paper, we propose a novel shape-contexts-based image hashing approach using robust local feature points. The contributions are twofold: 1) The robust SIFT-Harris detector is proposed to select the most stable SIFT keypoints under various content-preserving distortions. 2) Compact and robust image hashes are generated by embedding the detected local features into shape-contexts-based descriptors. Experimental results show that the proposed image hashing is robust to a wide range of distortions and attacks, due to the benefits of robust salient keypoints detection and the shape-contexts-based feature descriptors. When compared with the current state-of-the-art schemes, the proposed scheme yields better identification performances under geometric attacks such as rotation attacks and brightness changes, and provides comparable performances under classical distortions such as additive noise, blurring, and compression. Also, we demonstrate that the proposed approach could be applied for image tampering detection.},

abstract = {It is now accepted that the most effective video shot retrieval is based on indexing and retrieving clips using multiple, parallel modalities such as text-matching, image-matching and feature matching and then combining or fusing these parallel retrieval streams in some way. In this paper we investigate a range of fusion methods for combining based on multiple visual features (colour, edge and texture), for combining based on multiple visual examples in the query and for combining multiple modalities (text and visual). Using three TRECVid collections and the TRECVid search task, we specifically compare fusion methods based on normalised score and rank that use either the average, weighted average or maximum of retrieval results from a discrete Jelinek-Mercer smoothed language model. We also compare these results with a simple probability-based combination of the language model results that assumes all features and visual examples are fully independent.},

abstract = {Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machines (CRBMs) are rich probabilistic models that have recently been applied to a wide range of problems, including collaborative filtering, classification, and modeling motion capture data. While much progress has been made in training non-conditional RBMs, these algorithms are not applicable to conditional models and there has been almost no work on training and generating predictions from conditional RBMs for structured output problems. We first argue that standard Contrastive Divergence-based learning may not be suitable for training CRBMs. We then identify two distinct types of structured output prediction problems and propose an improved learning algorithm for each. The first problem type is one where the output space has arbitrary structure but the set of likely output configurations is relatively small, such as in multi-label classification. The second problem is one where the output space is arbitrarily structured but where the output space variability is much greater, such as in image denoising or pixel labeling. We show that the new learning algorithms can work much better than Contrastive Divergence on both types of problems.},

abstract = {Autoencoders play a fundamental role in unsupervised learning and in deep architectures for transfer learning and other tasks. In spite of their fundamental role, only linear au- toencoders over the real numbers have been solved analytically. Here we present a general mathematical framework for the study of both linear and non-linear autoencoders. The framework allows one to derive an analytical treatment for the most non-linear autoen- coder, the Boolean autoencoder. Learning in the Boolean autoencoder is equivalent to a clustering problem that can be solved in polynomial time when the number of clusters is small and becomes NP complete when the number of clusters is large. The framework sheds light on the different kinds of autoencoders, their learning complexity, their horizontal and vertical composability in deep architectures, their critical points, and their fundamental connections},

abstract = {Measuring image similarity is a central topic in computer vision. In this paper, we propose to measure image similarity by learning from the online Flickr image groups. We do so by: Choosing 103 Flickr groups, building a one-versus-all multiclass classifier to classify test images into a group, taking the set of responses of the classifiers as features, calculating the distance between feature vectors to measure image similarity. Experimental results on the Corel dataset and the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset show that our approach performs better on image matching, retrieval, and classification than using conventional visual features. To build our similarity measure, we need one-versus-all classifiers that are accurate and can be trained quickly on very large quantities of data. We adopt an SVM classifier with a histogram intersection kernel. We describe a novel fast training algorithm for this classifier: the Stochastic Intersection Kernel MAchine (SIKMA) training algorithm. This method can produce a kernel classifier that is more accurate than a linear classifier on tens of thousands of examples in minutes.},

Numerical simulations have shown that for simple classification and reinforcement learning tasks, at least one family of the new learning rules gives results comparable to those provided by the famous Rules A(r-i) and A(r-p) for the Boltzmann machines.},

abstract = {In this paper, a geometry-based image retrieval system is developed for multi-object images. We model both shape and topology of image objects using a structured representation called curvature tree (CT). The hierarchy of the CT reflects the inclusion relationships between the image objects. To facilitate shape-based matching, triangle-area representation (TAR) of each object is stored at the corresponding node in the CT. The similarity between two multi-object images is measured based on the maximum similarity subtree isomorphism (MSSI) between their CTs. For this purpose, we adopt a recursive algorithm to solve the MSSI problem and a very effective dynamic programming algorithm to measure the similarity between the attributed nodes. Our matching scheme agrees with many recent findings in psychology about the human perception of multi-object images. Experiments on a database of 13500 real and synthesized medical images and the MPEG-7 CE-1 database of 1400 shape images have shown the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

@article{Yu2011a,
abstract = {We present a method for learning image representations using a two-layer sparse coding scheme at the pixel level. The first layer encodes local patches of an image. After pooling within local regions, the first layer codes are then passed to the second layer, which jointly encodes signals from the region. Unlike traditional sparse coding methods that encode local patches independently, this approach accounts for high-order dependency among patterns in a local image neighborhood. We develop algorithms for data encoding and codebook learning, and show in experiments that the method leads to more invariant and discriminative image representations. The algorithm gives excellent results for hand-written digit recognition on MNIST and object recognition on the Caltech101 benchmark. This marks the first time that such accuracies have been achieved using automatically learned features from the pixel level, rather than using hand-designed descriptors.},

abstract = {To achieve its impressive performance in tasks such as speech perception or object recognition, the brain extracts multiple levels of representation from the sensory input. Backpropagation was the first computationally efficient model of how neural networks could learn multiple layers of representation, but it required labeled training data and it did not work well in deep networks. The limitations of backpropagation learning can now be overcome by using multilayer neural networks that contain top-down connections and training them to generate sensory data rather than to classify it. Learning multilayer generative models might seem difficult, but a recent discovery makes it easy to learn nonlinear distributed representations one layer at a time.},

abstract = {Type systems that permit developers to express themselves more precisely are one of the primary topics in programming language research, as well as in industrial software development. While it seems plausible that an expressive static type system increases developer productivity, there is little empirical evidence for or against this hypothesis. Generic types in Java are an example: as an extension of Java's original type system, some claim that Java 1.5 improves the type system's "expressiveness." Even if this claim is true, there exists little empirical evidence that claimed expressiveness leads to a measurable increase in developer productivity. This paper introduces an experiment where generic types (in comparison to raw types) have been evaluated in three different directions: (1) the documentation impact on undocumented APIs, (2) the time required for fixing type errors, and (3) the extensibility of a generic type hierarchy. The results of the experiment suggest that generic types improve documentation and reduce extensibility -- without revealing a difference in the time required for fixing type errors.},

abstract = {We propose a novel algorithm for weakly supervised semantic segmentation based on image-level class labels only. In weakly supervised setting, it is commonly observed that trained model overly focuses on discriminative parts rather than the entire object area. Our goal is to overcome this limitation with no additional human intervention by retrieving videos relevant to target class labels from web repository, and generating segmentation labels from the retrieved videos to simulate strong supervision for semantic segmentation. During this process, we take advantage of image classification with discriminative localization technique to reject false alarms in retrieved videos and identify relevant spatio-temporal volumes within retrieved videos. Although the entire procedure does not require any additional supervision, the segmentation annotations obtained from videos are sufficiently strong to learn a model for semantic segmentation. The proposed algorithm substantially outperforms existing methods based on the same level of supervision and is even as competitive as the approaches relying on extra annotations.},
